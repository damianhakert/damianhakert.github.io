title: GitLab CI Runner Dockerfile
---
<p>
<a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a> is an awesome tool to run virtual machines without overhead. Docker containers start in 2 seconds and use less memory and disk space. One requirements is that the host needs to be a Linux (virtual) machine.

<p>
If you use <a href="http://gitlab.org/gitlab-ci/">GitLab CI</a> to run your tests you have one or more runners performing the tests. More runners are better because they enable multiple tests running in parallel. With the new <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-ci-runner/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile for GitLab CI runner</a> you can add runners with less overhead. Enjoy!
