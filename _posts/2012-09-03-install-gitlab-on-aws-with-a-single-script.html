Since announcing the Gitlab.com plans we've been working on getting everything up and running. Part of this has been exploring the best way to install Gitlab. Although there is a good <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/installation.md">installation manua</a>l it was still a bit of work to set things up. To give back to the open source project we've <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pull/1318">contributed</a> a script to install Gitlab on Amazon Web Services with a single command:
<blockquote>curl https://raw.github.com/dosire/gitlabhq/non-interactive-aws-install/lib/support/aws/debian_ubuntu_aws.sh | sh</blockquote>
Read the HOWTO of <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/lib/support/aws/debian_ubuntu_aws.sh">the script</a> to learn more. Please file <a href="https://github.com/dosire/gitlabhq/issues?state=open">an issue</a> if you have problems or suggestions. We would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/randx">randx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tsigo">tsigo</a> for their feedback.

One of the next things to work on for us will be the <a href="https://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbook-gitlab">Chef cookbook for Gitlab</a>.
