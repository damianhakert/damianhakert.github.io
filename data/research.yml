questions:
  - question: What type of research do you do?
    answer: |
      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      Most surveys take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.

      <h3>Unmoderated usability testing</h3>
      We’re always looking for people to try out new and existing features and provide us with some feedback after using them. Unmoderated usability testing takes place remotely from the comfort of your own computer.

      If you take part in unmoderated usability testing, you will be asked to complete several short tasks whilst talking about your experience outloud. Your voice will be recorded along with your screen in order to track your mouse movement and clicks. In total, the tasks shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to complete.

      To take part in unmoderated usability testing, you must feel comfortable speaking out loud to yourself, as we’re relying on you to keep us posted on what you’re doing, thinking and feeling! It’s also important that we can hear you clearly, so the tasks must be completed in a quiet environment. 

      <h3>User interviews and moderated usability testing</h3>
      If you take part in a user interview or a moderated usability testing session, you’ll be speaking to one of our researchers remotely via web conferencing. 

      Our researchers love talking to users, both user interviews and moderated usability testing sessions are completely informal. We might be learning a little more about you and how you think about a problem or task. Or, watching you interact with a feature and asking you questions about your experience.

      The majority of user interviews and moderated usability testing sessions take between 20-30 minutes, but may be more or less dependant on the nature of the study. However, you will always be notified how long the study is likely to take and you’ll get to choose a convenient time and date to chat. 

      <h3>Field studies</h3>
      We visit you at your location and watch you work with GitLab. Field studies generally last from 1-2 hours.
