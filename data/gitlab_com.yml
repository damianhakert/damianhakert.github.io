questions:
  - question: What are build minutes?
    answer:
      Build minutes are the execution time for your pipelines on our shared runners.
  - question: What happens if I reach my build minutes limit?
    answer:
      If you reach your build limits, you simply won't be able to run any more builds until the end of your current billing cycle, or until you upgrade your account.
  - question: Do limits apply to public and private projects?
    answer:
      The build minutes limit only applies to private projects.
  - question: Does the build minute limit apply to private runners?
    answer:
      No. We will only restrict your minutes for our shared runners. If you have a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">private runner setup for your projects</a>, there is no limit to your build time on GitLab.com.
  - question: Is there a catch with the free forever plan?

      There is no catch. GitLab.com allows you to have unlimited free private repositories and collaborators.
