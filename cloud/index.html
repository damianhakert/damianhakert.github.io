              <h2>Security</h2>
              <p>GitLab is hosted on the Amazon AWS cloud. AWS has in the past successfully completed multiple SAS70 Type II audits, and now publishes a Service Organization Controls 1 (SOC 1), Type 2 report, published under both the SSAE 16 and the ISAE 3402 professional standards as well as a Service Organization Controls 2 (SOC 2) report. In addition, AWS has achieved ISO 27001 certification.</p> 
              <h2>Availability</h2>
              <p>GitLab Cloud is monitored 24/7. You can see its current and historic performance on our <a title="status" href="http://status.gitlab.com/">status page.</a></p>
              <h2>Why is GitLab Cloud free</h2>
              <p>We offer GitLab Cloud for free to widen the audience for GitLab. Many organizations that end up running GitLab on-premise started with GitLab Cloud. But many organizations never switch and keep using GitLab Cloud because it is a great service and this is fine with us. The income we generate with <a href='http://www.gitlab.com/subscription/'>subscriptions for on-premise installations</a> is sufficient to cover the costs of GitLab Cloud and our work on the GitLab Community Edition. In the future we might expand our Cloud offerings based on customer demand. We will likely add paid extra's for costly services such as phone support. But we plan to continue to offer the core service for free.</p>
