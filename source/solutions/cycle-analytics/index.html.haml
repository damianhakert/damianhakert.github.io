        Real data on your project

        Estimates are often incorrect. Stop estimating. Cycle Analytics lets you know how long it takes your team to complete each stage in their workflow from idea to production.

      %p
        One shared view of the team's velocity. Use data to make better decisions. With insights into how long it takes the team to move from idea to production, you can pinpoint areas for improvement and more accurately predict your releases.

          Cycle Analytics is pre-configured and ready to track your workflow. It follows the [GitLab Flow](/2016/07/27/the-11-rules-of-gitlab-flow/){: .purple} and records the median time it takes the team to complete each stage.

                    This stage measures the time between creating an issue and taking action to solve it, by either 
                    labeling it or adding it to a milestone, whatever comes first. The label will be tracked only if it already has an [Issue Board](/solutions/issueboard) list created for it.

                    This stage measures the time between the action you took for the previous stage, and pushing the first commit to the repository. To make this change tracked, you need to add the tag `closes #xxx`, where `xxx` is the number of the issue related to this commit.

The key to keep the process tracked is adding the tag `closes/fixes #xxx` to the description of the MR.

                    This stage measures the time between merging the MR until the app is deployed to production. It's tracked by the [`environment` set to `production`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments.html#sts=Introduction) in your GitLab CI configuration.
