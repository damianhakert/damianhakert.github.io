      What is the GitLab Cycle Analytics?
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1

      %h3
        Real data
      %p
        Estimates of time or level of effort are often incorrect. Stop estimating. Know how many days or minutes it takes your team to get from idea to production.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-2", "feature-icon", { label: "Beautiful and comprehensive" })
      %h3
        Overviews and drill downs
      %p
        Measure your team's total and step-by-step velocity. Cycle analytics indicates the total time it takes to move from idea to production as well as the time it takes to move from one stage to another.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-3", "feature-icon", { label: "Better metrics, better decisions" })
      %h3
        Built for teams and managers
      %p
        Use shared metrics to make better decisions. With insights into how long it takes the team to move from idea to production, you can pinpoint areas of improvement and more accurately predict your releases.
