          Estimates are often incorrect. Stop estimating.

          Cycle Analytics lets you know how long it takes your team to complete each stage in their workflow from idea to production.

          One shared view of the team's velocity.

          With insights into how long it takes the team to move from idea to production, you can pinpoint areas for improvement.

          Cycle Analytics is pre-configured and ready to track your workflow. 

          It follows the [GitLab Flow](/2016/07/27/the-11-rules-of-gitlab-flow/){: .purple} and records the median time it takes the team to complete each stage.

                    This stage measures the time between creating an issue and taking action to solve it, by either assigning it to a milestone or moving it into a list on your [Issue Board](/solutions/issueboard), whichever comes first.

                    This stage measures the time between the action you took for the previous stage, and pushing the first commit to the repository.

                    GitLab tracks this using the [issue closing pattern](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/issues/automatic_issue_closing.html) like `closes #xxx`, where `xxx` is the number of the issue related to this commit.

                    GitLab tracks this using the [issue closing pattern](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/issues/automatic_issue_closing.html) like `closes #xxx` in the MR description, where `xxx` is the number of the issue related to this merge request.

                    This stage measures the time to run the entire pipeline for that project.

                    It's related to the time [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/quick_start/README.html) takes to run every job for the commits pushed to that MR defined in the previous stage.

                    This stage measures the time spent in staging, from merging the MR until the app is deployed to production.

                    It's tracked by the [`environment` set to `production`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments.html#sts=Introduction) in your GitLab CI configuration.

                    This is the measure of the time taken to run entire process, from creating an issue to deploying the code to production.

                    In fact, this is the time your team takes to go [from idea to production](/2016/08/05/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment-with-gitlab/#from-idea-to-production-with-gitlab)!
