        <p>Please email support@gitlab.com to report any security vulnerabilities. Please refrain from requesting compensation for reporting vulnerabilities.

If you want we will <a title="Vulnerability Acknowledgements" href="/vulnerability-acknowledgements/">publicly acknowledge</a> your responsible disclosure.</p>
        <p>You are not allowed to search for vulnerabilities on GitLab.com itself. GitLab is open source software, you can install a copy yourself and test against that. If you want to perform testing that might break things please contact us to arrange access to a staging server.</p>
