---

Please report any security vulnerabilities by creating a [confidential issue](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/31/feature-highlihght-confidential-issues/) on the [GitLab CE issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues). If the vulnerability is _about_ confidential issues, then please email security@gitlab.com instead.

Please refrain from requesting compensation for reporting vulnerabilities. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress. If you want we will [publicly acknowledge](https://about.gitlab.com/vulnerability-acknowledgements/) your responsible disclosure. You may also send us your report via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/gitlab).  


You are not allowed to search for vulnerabilities on GitLab.com itself. GitLab
is open source software, you can install a copy yourself and test against that.
If you want to perform testing that might break things please contact us to
arrange access to a staging server.


If you want to encrypt your disclosure email please email us to ask for our PGP key.
