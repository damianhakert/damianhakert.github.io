## Having trouble convincing your boss to buy GitLab?

Having trouble convincing your boss to buy GitLab? Here's a step-by-step guide to the value GitLab provides.

*TODO List the steps of the SDLC and allow clicks https://12factor.net/ => don't make it a feature page, no screenshots, answer the why you should do it, link from those pages to the feature pages (the what). Make it a page on our site. /sdlc be a resource for people that want to convince their boss.*  
*TODO Every step described, link to both 2 competitors and our product.*

### Idea / Chat (Slack)
For the Idea stage, we believe a lot of ideas come from Chat, so we have a chat client, Mattermost, that ships with GitLab’s Omnibus installation. And we recently integrated both Mattermost and Slack for Chat Commands.
* Why
* Feature page:
* Competitors:
### Issue / Issue Tracker (JIRA)
Then we have GitLab issue tracker.
### Plan / Issue Boards (Trello)
And we recently released GitLab Issue Board for planning.
### Code / Web terminal (Cloud9)
For coding, we have our online file editor, but now, with 8.15, we have a new Web Terminal, which I’ll show later.
### Commit / Repositories (GitHub)
For committing, of course we’ve got GitLab repositories.
### Test / CI and Container Registry (Travis CI and DockerHub)
For testing, we’ve got GitLab CI/CD for continuous integration and testing, and Container Registry.
### Review / Merge Requests and Review Apps (GitHub and Heroku)
For review there’s merge requests and recently we added Review Apps to see a live preview of merge requests.
### Staging / GitLab Auto Deploy (Jenkins)
For staging, GitLab CI/CD has been heavily extended to include continuous delivery.
### Production / Chatops (Hubot)
For production, we support continuous deployment with GitLab CI/CD, and we now have a ChatOps integration with Mattermost and Slack.
### Feedback / Prometheus (New Relic)
For feedback, we recently launched Cycle Analytics and I’m really excited to announce we’ve starting bundling Prometheus for monitoring in GitLab 8.16.
