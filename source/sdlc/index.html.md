## Having trouble convincing your boss to buy GitLab?

Having trouble convincing your boss to buy GitLab? Here's a step-by-step guide to the value GitLab provides.

*TODO List the steps of the SDLC and allow clicks https://12factor.net/ => don't make it a feature page, no screenshots, answer the why you should do it, link from those pages to the feature pages (the what). Make it a page on our site. /sdlc be a resource for people that want to convince their boss.*  
*TODO Every step described, link to both 2 competitors and our product.*

### Idea / Chat (Slack)
We believe a lot of ideas come from Chat, so we have a chat client, [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/), that ships with GitLab’s [Omnibus installation](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/). And we recently integrated both Mattermost and Slack for Chat Commands.

### Issue / Issue Tracker (JIRA)
Issues help you summarize your ideas and align the team on a common goal.

### Plan / Issue Boards (Trello)
Issue boards let you manage your workflow. Everything is in one place. Track issues and communicate progress without switching between products. One interface to follow your issues from backlog to done.

### Code / Web terminal (Cloud9)
For coding, we have our online file editor, but now, with 8.15, we have a new Web Terminal, which I’ll show later.
