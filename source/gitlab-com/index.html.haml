            Why GitLab.com will be free forever

          We want GitLab.com to become the most popular service for hosting
          projects. To achieve this goal, GitLab.com is free, both for public
          and private projects. Unlike other companies in this space, there is
          no limit to the number of collaborators. We think that in the future
          most repository hosting will be free in the same way email hosting is
          free today. So we thought, why wait? Let's make it free for everyone
          now. Our subscriptions for GitLab EE on-premises bring in more
          than enough revenue to pay for the hosting of GitLab.com.
          The revenues from EE and EE options are growing fast enough to keep up with the growth in GitLab.com usage.
          We see GitLab.com as a way to make GitLab more known and popular. In the future we might
          introduce paid features like projects sizes above 10GB and Windows/OSX CI Runners.
          We intend to keep the features that you have now free and monetize only new features.
