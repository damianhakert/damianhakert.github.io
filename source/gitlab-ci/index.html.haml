          %ul
            %li
              %b Integrated:
              GitLab CI is part of GitLab. You can use it for free on
              %a{:href => "https://gitlab.com/"} GitLab.com
            %li
              %b Easy to learn:
              See our
              %a{:href => "http://doc.gitlab.com/ci/quick_start/README.html"} Quick Start
              guide
            %li
              %b Beautiful:
              GitLab CI offers the same great experience as GitLab. Familiar, easy to use, and beautiful.
            %li
              %b Scalable:
              Tests run distributed on separate machines of which you can add as many as you want
            %li
              %b Faster results:
              Each build can be split in multiple jobs that run in parallel on multiple machines
            %li
              %b Open source:
              CI is included with both the open source GitLab Community Edition and the proprietary GitLab Enterprise Edition

          %ul
            %li
              %b Multi-platform:
              You can execute builds on Unix, Windows and OSX.
            %li
              %b Multi-language:
              Build scripts are command line driven and work with Java, PHP, Ruby, C, and any other language.
            %li
              %b Stable:
              Your builds run on a different machine than GitLab.
            %li
              %b Parallel builds:
              GitLab CI splits builds over multiple machines, for fast execution.
            %li
              %b Realtime logging:
              A link in the merge request takes you to the current build log that updates dynamically.
            %li
              %b Versioned tests:
              A
              %a{:href => "http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/README.html"} .gitlab-ci.yml file
              that contains your tests, allowing everyone to contribute changes and ensuring every branch gets the tests it needs.
            %li
              %b Continuous Delivery (CD):
              Continuous delivery and deployment are easy with multiple types of jobs, environmental variables and the

              %b GitLab CI
              is a part of GitLab, a web application with an API
              that stores its state in a database.
              It manages projects/builds and provides a nice user interface,
              besides all the features of GitLab.

              In order to run tests, you need at least one

          %p To perform the actual build, you need to install GitLab Runner which is written in Go.
          %p
            It can run on any platform for which you can build Go binaries,
            including Linux, OSX, Windows, FreeBSD and Docker.
          %p
            It can test any programming language including .Net, Java, Python, C, PHP and others. There are
            %a{:href => "https://about.gitlab.com/applications/#runners"} other runners written in Java and Javascript
            but we recommend using the Go runner to test all languages.
          %p
            The official Go Runner has
            %a{:href => "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner#features"} many features
            including great Docker support and the ability to run multiple jobs concurrently.
