        <h3>Security of GitLab as an open-source product</h3>
            <p>
                GitLab CE is open source and has over 700 contributors.
                This means there have been over 700 pairs of eyes looking at the GitLab CE source code.
                GitLab EE is open-core, which means the source code is also open for inspection to our customers.
            </p>

        <h3>GitLab development guidelines</h3>
