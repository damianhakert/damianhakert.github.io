## Security of GitLab by Being an Open-Source Product<a name="open-source-security"></a>

GitLab CE is open source and has over 700 contributors.
This means there have been over 700 pairs of eyes looking at the GitLab CE source code.
GitLab EE is open-core, which means the source code is also open for inspection to our customers.

## GitLab Development Guidelines<a name="gitlab-development-guidelines"></a>

* [Guidelines for shell commands in the GitLab codebase](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/development/shell_commands.md)
* For community contributions, we enforce [style guides](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guides)
* In addition, both for community contributions and for internal development, we use [brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org/) and [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) run by GitLab CI.
* We engage security experts to do white box testing such as fault injection (manual), penetration testing (manual) and vulnerabilities testing (both automatic, and manual)

GitLab also has a [responsible disclosure program](https://about.gitlab.com/disclosure/).

   - YES

1. Is a user's identity verified before communicating an initial/temporary password or initiating a password reset by an automated or manual process?
   - YES

1. Do application, system, and device passwords (including routers, firewalls, databases, and external social spaces) require passwords to have the following characteristics: 1. minimum length of 8 characters, 2. chosen from any acceptable character sets available on the target system, 3. includes at least one alphabetic and one numeric character.)
   - YES

1. Are passwords prevented from being displayed in clear text during user authentication or in electronic/printed reports?
   - YES

1. Are passwords/PINs sent to users utilizing a secure method (e.g. secure e-mail) and sent separately from other authentication information such as the user account?

   - YES

1. If user accounts are assigned to non-permanent personnel (e.g., contractors, consultants)  for troubleshooting purposes, are the accounts disabled or removed after each use?
   - YES

1. Is the retirement or replacement of encryption keys included in key management procedures when the integrity of the key has been weakened (such as departure of an employee with key knowledge) or keys are suspected of being compromised?
   - YES

1. If you use cloud services, do you ensure that confidential data or an aggregation of proprietary information that can reveal confidential information is encrypted to ensure confidentiality at rest and in transit?
   - YES

1. If you use cloud services, do you have key management procedures to manage and maintain encryption keys?
   - YES

1. Is GitLab HIPAA compliant?
   - NO. GitLab is not certified to be compliant with HIPAA. Given GitLab's role in the development process, HIPAA requirements typically are not relevant as GitLab does not store, process or transmit patient data. That said, GitLab can be used as a way to ensure HIPAA compliance. For example, GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) is run on the customer's servers, behind their firewall. Customers have complete control over the information that is handled by GitLab's product and GitLab has no way to access this data. The fact that GitLab EE runs behind the customer's firewall provides further assurance that their development process can be HIPAA compliant. 

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)<a name="sdlc"></a>

1. Are there documented processes, procedures, standards and templates used in your SDLC process?
   - YES. See our [Contributing guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/contributing/), and related documentation on [code review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/development/code_review.md) and [development processes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/doc/development).

1. Do the materials above  include references to application security best-practices and principles being followed?

1. Does the quality assurance organization have authority to delay shipment of releases due to non-conformance reasons?
   - YES.

1. Is some form of static code scanning performed as part of the release acceptance? What tools are used?
   - YES. For example, [brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) and [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) are part of our test suite to be alerted to any security issues in our dependent Ruby libraries.

1. Is some form of dynamic code scanning performed as part of the release acceptance? What tools are used?
   - YES. We use GitLab CI for this purpose.

## Business Continuity Plan<a name="business-continuity-plan"></a>

GitLab, by it's remote-only nature, is not easily affected by typical causes of business disruption, such as local failures of equipment, power supplies, telecommunications, social unrest, terrorist attacks, fire, or natural disasters. Even so, threats considered in the context of business continuity are categorized by impact of the disruption.

**P1: Outage would have immediate impact on GitLab customer / user operations**

1. Disruption of service of Azure, specifically the region in which GitLab.com and dev.gitlab.org are hosted.
   - Effect: a loss of the Azure service means that GitLab.com is not available. This affects anyone who uses GitLab.com to host their repositories. GitLab.com is also the primary server where GitLab CE and EE source code and packages are hosted.
   - Solution(s): There are many other servers across the globe where GitLab CE is readily available.
   - Effect: Security releases are developed and staged on dev.gitlab.org before being brought to production on GitLab.com; these may be lost or unavailable for the duration of the disruption.
   - Solution(s): Depending on the duration and nature of the disruption, the solution is to wait for service to be restored (minimal duration), or build a new staging server. Using VM snapshots, recovery from backup is relatively quick.

1. Unavailability of support staff in case of customer emergency.
   - Effect: emergency response times are greater than intended.
   - Solution(s): The team is distributed geographically (except during team get-togethers). Customer emergencies are handled by _any_ person who is in the [on-call rotation](/handbook/on-call). The on-call load is distributed at many levels, service engineers, production engineers, and even developers can be summoned when we have an outage or a customer incident. Emergencies also trigger automatic notifications on our internal chat system, alerting the entire company. There is also an ongoing effort to publish our [runbooks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks), explaining how we manage our infrastructure and how we deal with outage cases.

1. Disruption of service of ZenDesk.
   - Effect: support workflows are disrupted. New tickets cannot be created, existing tickets cannot be responded to.
   - Solution(s): For the duration of the outage (if more than e.g. 4 hours) temporarily re-route incoming support requests to individual email accounts of members of the support team. Customers with premium support also have access to a direct chat channel.

**P2: Outage would have immediate impact on GitLab ability to continue business**

1. Malicious Software (Viruses, Worms, Trojan horses) attack.
   - Effect: depends on attack.
   - Solution(s): All the hosts in our fleet are running rkhunter every day to check for known rootkits. We get notifications whenever we detect a change in any of our hosted systems. Each case is handled manually for now.

1. Hacking or other Internet attacks.
   - Effect: depends on attack.
   - Solution(s): We log and track any access that happens on any server in the fleet using logstash/kibana at log.gitlap.com.


**P3: Outage greater than 72 hours would have impact on GitLab ability to continue to do business**

Disruption of service from Salesforce.com, Zuora
   - No failover plan currently.

**P4: Outage greater than 10 business days would have impact on GitLab ability to continue business**

Disruption of service from TriNet, NetSuite, Google (gmail)
   - No failover plan currently.

**P5: Non critical system**

Disruption of service from Egencia, or internal chat tool.
   - No failover plan currently.
