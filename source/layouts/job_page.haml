      GitLab Inc. is a company based on the GitLab open-source project. GitLab is
      a community project to which over 1,000 people worldwide have contributed.
      We are an active participant in this community, trying to serve its needs
      and lead by example. We have one [vision]: everyone can contribute to all
      digital content, and our mission is to change all creative work from
      read-only to read-write so that everyone can contribute.

      We [value] results, transparency, sharing, freedom, efficiency, frugality,
      collaboration, directness, kindness, diversity, boring solutions, and
      quirkiness. If these values match your personality, work ethic, and personal
      goals, we encourage you to visit our [primer] to learn more. Open source is
      our culture, our way of life, our story, and what makes us truly unique.
