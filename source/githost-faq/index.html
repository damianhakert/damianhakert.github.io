        <h3>What is GitHost?</h3>
            <p>
               GitHost is a single-tenant solution that provides GitLab CE or EE as a managed service. GitLab Inc. is responsible for installing, updating, hosting, and backing up customers own private and secure GitLab instance.
            </p>

        <h3>Why should I use GitHost?</h3>
            <p>
               <li>GitHost removes the system administration overhead of having to manage hardware, infrastructure, upgrades and back-ups, without compromising security</li>
               <li>It allows customers to concentrate on their core business of delivering applications to end users</li>
               <li>It facilitates the use of GitLab for organizations who do have experience in GitLab, Linux or MySQL/PostgreSQL</li>
            </p>
            
        <h3>What is different about GitHost than other hosted Git solutions?</h3>
            <p>
               <li>Unlike GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org and GitLab.com, GitHost is a single-tenant solution which means your IP does not share the underlying infrastructure with other customers</li>
               <li>GitHost can integrate with your Active Directory or LDAP server for better authentication, as well as SAML, Crowd and all the OmniAuth Providers supported by GitLab</li>
               <li>GitHost has better performance than other hosted Git solutions because each instance only servers one customer, rather than many customers to one instance</li>
               <li>You can choose between automatic and manual updates. If you want, your server will always be automatically updated to the latest GitLab version, or you can stay on your current version and choose when you want the upgrade to happen</li>
            </p>
