      %p Many core team members did a lot of fixes, improvements and refactoring. The above list indicates some of their specialties but it is not complete.
      %p
        GitLab core team members who are no longer active but whose work is very much appreciated can be found on the
        = succeed "." do
          %a{href: "/alumni"} core team alumni page
      %p
        The GitLab core-team is not bound to any single (not-)for-profit organization.
        This arrangement is similar to those of the Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Linux and PostgreSQL projects.
        There is no formal process, team members discuss topics on the
        %a{href: "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gitlab-core"} private gitlab-core mailing list
        and Slack channel.
        You can get invited for the core team after
        %a{href: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"} contributing
        to GitLab for a sustained period of time.
        You can contribute by coding but also by giving feedback on merge requests, triaging on the issue tracker or helping out on the mailinglist.
        Core contributors are invited after a proposal from a core-team member that gets two positive responses on the core-team mailing list and no negative ones.
