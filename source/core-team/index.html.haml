        %h2.title Dmitriy Zaporozhets
        %p Dmitriy started GitLab in September 2011 and has released it every month on the 22nd since then. He wanted to make a great and free project management system that he could use every day. He loved to work on GitLab so much that in January of 2013 he began to work on GitLab fulltime. When he has time he loves to code a major new GitLab feature in two days. He loves a good Martini and a merge request that can be accepted without comments.

        %h2.title Marin Jankovski
        %p Marin loves to develop in Rails but has also grown an interest in operations, specifically Amazon Web Services and Opscode Chef. When video conferencing with him you get a cat running accross the room as a bonus. He is notorious for starting early in the morning just after breakfast and not having lunch until his workday is over. You would expect him to be hungry and grumpy the last few hours but as long as his internet connection is up he is always friendly and upbeat. He loves travelling and talking. A lot of talking. A lot.

        %p Sytse saw the first ruby code in 2007 and loved it so much he dove head first into programming. Before that he was engaged in business administration roles and combining that with software development is his passion. He is always looking to make a template out of something or to automate a process. His team members suspect he has todo list and reminders for everything, including breakfast and getting his hair cut. He loves a good beer and organizing a trip to a conference.

          His linux distro of choice is Archlinux, although since 2013 he's enjoying making packages for Fedora. You'll often listen him

          he practises Aikido, reads Bukowski and enjoys a good meal he cooked all by himself.

      %p Many core team members did a lot of fixes, improvements and refactoring. The above list indicates some of their specialties but it is not complete.

      %p
        The GitLab core-team is not bound to any single (not-)for-profit organization.
        This arrangement is similar to those of the Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Linux and PostgreSQL projects.
        There is no formal process, team members discuss topics on the
        %a{href: "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gitlab-core"} private gitlab-core mailing list
        and Slack channel.
        You can get invited for the core team after
        %a{href: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"} contributing
        to GitLab for a sustained period of time.
        You can contribute by coding but also by giving feedback on merge requests, triaging on the issue tracker or helping out on the mailinglist.
        Core contributors are invited after a proposal from a core-team member that gets two positive responses on the core-team mailing list and no negative ones.
