## A brief history of GitLab

### _2011: Start of GitLab_

In 2011 Dmitriy was unsatisfied with the options for git repository management.
So together with Valery, he started to build GitLab as a solution for this.

[This commit] was the very start of GitLab.

### _2012: GitLab.com_

Sid saw GitLab for the first time.
He thought it was natural that a collaboration tool for programmers was open source.
Being a Ruby programmer he checked out the source code and was impressed with the code quality of GitLab.
He started GitLab.com as the first SaaS offering for GitLab.

In November 2012, Dmitriy also made the [first version of GitLab CI].

### _2013: "I want to work on GitLab full time"_

In 2013, Dmitriy tweeted that he wanted to work on GitLab full time.
Sid and Dmitriy teamed up and started bootstrapping GitLab as a company.

In the same year in August, we introduced [GitLab Enterprise Edition].

### _2014: GitLab was incorporated_

In 2014 GitLab was officially incorporated as a limited liability corporation.
GitLab released a new version every month on the 22nd, just as every year before and after.
The first release of the year at January 22nd: GitLab 6.5. At the end of 2014, December 2014, GitLab 7.6 was released.

### _2015: Y Combinator_

In the very start of 2015, almost the entire GitLab team flew over to Silicon
Valley to [participate in Y Combinator].

At this point, over 1000 people worldwide have [contributed to GitLab] and more
than 100,000 organizations are using GitLab.

## Vision

## Our stewardship of GitLab CE<a name="stewardship"></a><a name="our-stewardship-of-gitlab-ce"></a>

GitLab Inc. is a for profit company that balances the need to improve
GitLab Community Edition (CE) with the need to add features to GitLab
Enterprise Edition (EE) exclusively in order to generate income.
We have an [open core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_core) business model and generate almost all our revenue with [subscriptions to use Enterprise Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).
We recognize that we need to balance the need to generate income and with the needs of the open source project.

We promise that:

1. We won't remove features from CE in order to make the same feature exclusive in EE (features might be removed from CE due to changes in the application)
1. We won't introduce features into CE with a delay, if a feature is planned to land in both it will be released simultaneously in both
1. We will always release all tests that we have for a feature that is in CE
1. CE will have all the features that are essential to running a large 'forge' with public and private repositories
1. CE will not contain any artificial limits (repositories, users, size, performance, etc.)
1. All major features in [our scope]() will be available in GitLab CE too
1. The majority of new features made by GitLab Inc. will be available in both CE and EE
1. CE will be available for download without leaving an email address

Apart from making new features GitLab Inc. does a lot of work that benefits both CE and EE:

1. [Responsible disclosure](https://about.gitlab.com/disclosure/) process and security fixes
1. [Release management](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/release/README.html) including a monthly release of both CE and EE
1. Packaging GitLab in our [Omnibus packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)
1. Running a [packages server](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/)
1. Dependency upgrades (Rails, gems, etc.)
1. Performance improvements

When we make new features we ask ourselves, is this feature **more relevant for organizations that have more than 100 potential users**?
If the answer is yes the feature is likely to be exclusive to EE.
We always make sure that CE can do all essential things and there are companies using CE with more than 10,000 developers.

When someone contributes a feature to CE that is already in EE we have a hard decision to make.
We hope that people focus on contributing features that are neither in CE nor EE.
This way both edits benefit from a new feature and GitLab Inc. don't have to make a hard decision.
The features we plan to build for EE are shared on our [direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) and we welcome people to contribute features to CE that are planned for future EE releases, if you pick one from the upcoming release please ask in the issue if someone is already working on it.
When someone does contribute a feature to CE that is already in EE we weigh a couple of factors in that decision:

1. What is the quality of the submitted code?
1. Is it a complete replacement of the EE functionality?
1. Does it meet the criteria of the [definition of done](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#definition-of-done)?
1. Is it more relevant for organizations that have more than 100 potential users?
1. Is the person or organizating submitting this using GitLab with more or less than 100 potential users?
1. Did the person or organization submitting this contribute to GitLab before?
1. Is it something that many of our existing customers choose GitLab Enterprise Edition for?
1. Is it relevant for running a large open source forge?
1. Is it an original work or based on the EE code?
1. Is there an actively maintained fork that incorporates this?
1. How many organizations are using this code in production?
1. How frequently has this functionality been requested for CE and by whom?

We'll weight all factors and you can judge our stewardship of CE based on the outcome. So far (July 22, 2016) we had only two cases, one had low code quality and the other one copied the EE code down to the last space. If you find these or other examples please link them here so people can get an idea of the outcome.

In case we're not sure, we'll consult with the [core team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/) to reach a conclusion.
