        <h4>Vision</h4>
        <p>Our vision is that every digital product that is created by more than one person should be managed in distributed version control.
        This allows people to cooperate effectively and to achieve better results, faster.</p>
        <h4>Mission and logo</h4>
        <p>We are part of a community that works together to create the best open source collaboration tools.
        Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog">racoon dog</a> logo symbolizes this with a smart animal that works in a group to achieve a common goal.
        We would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityonmars">Ricardo Rauch</a> for contributing the logo.</p>
        <h4>Values</h4>
        <p>We care about giving back to the rest of the GitLab community, that is why we give most code back to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/">Community Edition</a>.
        We try to be open, that is why this website is maintained in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/">a public repository</a>.
        We realize that GitLab is more than this organization, this is shown by having people from outside this company in the <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/core-team/">core team</a>.
        We think good code can be written by anyone, we encourage diversity by contributing to <a href="http://railsgirls.nl/">RailsGirls NL</a>.
        We try to correct the mistakes we make, please give us a chance by <a href="mailto:contact@gitlab.com">emailing us</a>.</p>
        <h4>Team Handbook</h4>
        <p>If you're interested, our <a href="/team-handbook">team handbook is public.</a></p>
