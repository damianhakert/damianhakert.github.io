## A brief history of GitLab

### _2011: Start of GitLab_

In 2011 Dmitriy was unsatisfied with the options for git repository management.
So together with Valery, he started to build GitLab as a solution for this.

[This commit] was the very start of GitLab.

### _2012: GitLab.com_

Sytse began a SaaS of GitLab, which until then was only an open source project
that could be ran on your own servers. GitLab.com offered free and paid hosting
of git projects to anyone.

In November 2012, Dmitriy also made the [first version of GitLab CI].

### _2013: "I want to work on GitLab full time"_

In 2013, Dmitriy tweeted that he wanted to work on GitLab full time.
Sytse and Dmitriy teamed up and started bootstrapping GitLab as a company.

In the same year in August, we introduced [GitLab Enterprise Edition].

### _2014: GitLab was incorporated_

In 2014 GitLab was officially incorporated in the Netherlands.

GitLab released a new version every month in 2014, just as every year before it.
The first release of the year at January 22nd: GitLab 6.5. At the end of 2014, December 2014, GitLab
7.6 was released.

### _2015: Y Combinator_

In the very start of 2015, almost the entire GitLab team flew over to Silicon
Valley to [participate in Y Combinator].

At this point, over 800 people worldwide have [contributed to GitLab] and more
than 100,000 organizations are using GitLab.

## Vision
Our vision is that every digital product that is created by more than one person
should be managed in distributed version control.
This allows people to cooperate effectively and to achieve better results, faster.

## Mission and logo
We are part of a community that works together to create the best open source collaboration tools.
Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog">Tanuki</a> logo 
symbolizes this with a smart animal that works in a group to achieve a common goal.

## Values
We care about giving back to the rest of the GitLab community, that is why we 
give most code back to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/">Community Edition</a>.
We try to be open, that is why this website is maintained in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/">a public repository</a>.
We realize that GitLab is more than this organization, this is shown by having 
people from outside this company in the <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/core-team/">core team</a>.
We think good code can be written by anyone, we encourage diversity by contributing to <a href="http://railsgirls.nl/">RailsGirls NL</a>.
We try to correct the mistakes we make, please give us a chance by <a href="mailto:contact@gitlab.com">emailing us</a>.

## Our stewardship of GitLab CE<a name="stewardship"></a><a name="our-stewardship-of-gitlab-ce"></a>

GitLab Inc. is a for profit company that balances the need to improve
GitLab Community Edition (CE) with the need to add features to GitLab
Enterprise Edition (EE) exclusively in order to generate more income.

We promise that:

1. We won't remove features from CE to make the same feature exclusive in EE
1. We won't introduce features into CE with a delay, if a feature is planned to land in both it will be released simultaneously in both
1. CE will have all the features that are essential to running a large 'forge' with public and private repositories
1. CE will not contain any artificial limits (repo's, users, size, etc)
1. The majority of new features made by GitLab Inc. will be for both CE and EE

Apart from making new features GitLab Inc. does a lot of work that benefits both CE and EE:

1. [Responsible disclosure](https://about.gitlab.com/disclosure/) process and security fixes
1. [Release management](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/release/README.html) including a montly release of both CE and EE
1. Packaging GitLab in our [Omnibus packages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)
1. Running a [packages server](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/)
1. Dependency upgrades (Rails, gems, etc.)
1. Performance improvements

When someone contributes a feature to CE that is already in EE we have a hard decision to make.
We hope that people focus on contributing features that are neither in CE nor EE so everyone benefits and we don't have to make that decision.
When we do have to make it we weigh a couple of factors in that decision:

1. What is the quality of the code?
1. Is it complete and does it meet the criterial of the [definition of done](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#definition-of-done)?
1. What is the use case for this, is it needed for organizations with less than 100 people?
1. Is it an original work or based on EE (someone once sent a merge request with our exact EE code)?

In case we're not sure we'll consult with the [core team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team/) to reach a conclusion.
