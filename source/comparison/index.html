          Since GitLab people wrote them the comparisons here might be biased.
          Nonetheless we try hard to ensure the comparisons are fair and factual.
          If you find something that is invalid, biased or out of date in the comparisons,
          please open a
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests">merge request for this website</a>
           to correct it.
          As on all the pages on this website you can find a link to this page in the repository in the footer. We can help with migration services as part of a custom GitLab EE plan. Please <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/sales/">contact sales</a> if you would like to learn more.
