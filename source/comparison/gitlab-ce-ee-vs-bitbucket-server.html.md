## GitLab CE/EE vs. BitBucket Server

### Built-in Continuous Integration tool
Easy-to-set up, performant, stable and elegant continuous integration with every GitLab installation.

[Learn about the benefits of our CI tool](http://doc.gitlab.com/ci/)

### More value with everything you need in one solution
To replace GitLab, you'd need a combination of Bitbucket server, JIRA, Confluence, and Bamboo.

### Great user interface
GitLab has a really nice user interface that your team will love, and also enjoy working with.

### Integrated issue tracking
GitLab includes an issue tracker which you can link to any merge request.

### Better activity feed and visualization
Collaborative activity feed to help everyone understand what is happening in a project and graphical view of the commit history.

[See Our Activity Feed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/activity)

### Full, powerful search
Search through all your code, issues, wikis, commits, groups and projects. Built into GitLab.
