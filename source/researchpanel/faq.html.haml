          At GitLab, we value
          #{link_to('transparency', 'https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/')}.
          By making information public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. With your permission, we record all user interviews and usability testing sessions. We would also love to share the recording on GitLab.  This is completely voluntary and up to you. In any use of the recordings, no personally identifiable information will be disclosed. We'll ask for your consent before you complete any user interviews or usability testing with GitLab.
