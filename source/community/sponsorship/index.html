        <h1>Community Sponsorship</h1>
        <p class="lead">GitLab would like to reach out and grow the community.</p>
        <p>Each year GitLab sponsors a number of large events in Europe and North America and we send our team to speak or teach workshops in the most farflung parts of the globe. In 2016 we are sponsoring larger initatives such as <a href="https://rubytogether.org/">Ruby Together</a>, but would like to expand our reach into the community through a more localized sponsorship program.</p>

        <h3>How we can help</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Financial assistance, in some cases.</li>
          <li>Venue, food, drinks and some flashy GitLab swag for GitLab meet-ups.</li>
          <li>Coaching, mentors and speakers for events.</li>
          <li>Assistance in promotion of your GitLab-focused event.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Our highest priorities </h3>
        <p>All applications will be reviewed by our team. Our highest priority in selecting events to support is to reach the greatest number of people and grow the open source GitLab community.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Events or intiatives which foster diversity, especially in underserved regions and communities.</li>
          <li>Events or intiatives which help mentor young people in finding a path to software development fluency.</li>
          <li>Events where our users meet, such as GitLab meetups.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We would like to sponsor events related to issues and solutions that GitLab users face every day, such as DevOps, open source and collaboration. If you think you have an event where people would like to get to know more about GitLab and our community, please do contact us. We certainly haven't thought of everything.</p>
        <h3>A special grant for Diversity events</h3>
        <p>In February 2016, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/02/02/gitlab-diversity-sponsorship/">we announced a $500 USD grant</a> for ALL events which promote diversity in technology. Yep, all events which help increase diversity in technology fields. </p>
        <p>What events are eligible?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any event which helps increase participation from underrepresented groups in their local regions.</li>
          <li>Any event outside of NYC or Bay Area.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A grant for open science</h3>
        <p>We are also offering a special grant for the integration of GitLab into the Open Science Framework (OSF). Please read how you can help: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/03/a-grant-to-help-us-integrate-gitlab-with-open-source-osf/">OSF grant.</a></p>
