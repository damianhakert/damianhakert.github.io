## Want to share your enthusiasm for GitLab?

We know people in our community would love to get together to
meet and talk about using GitLab, and all the ways you collaborate on code.

It's great that Gitlab users all write different kinds of applications,
you work within other software communities, yet you all share the experience
of collaborating, communicating and deploying with GitLab.
