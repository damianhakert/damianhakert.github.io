## Why

GitLab was created because Dmitriy needed an affordable tool to collaborate with his team. He wanted something efficient and enjoyable so he could focus on his work, not the tools. He worked on it from home, a house in Ukraine without running water.

We think that it is logical that our collaboration tools are a collaborative work themselves. More than 1000 people have contributed to GitLab to make that a reality. We believe in a world where **everyone can contribute**. Allowing everyone to make a proposal is the core of what a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) such as Git enables. No invite needed: if you can see it, you can contribute.

We believe that all digital products should be open to contributions, from legal documents to movie scripts and from websites to chip designs. GitLab Inc. will develop great open source software to enable people to collaborate in this way.

1. To ensure that **everyone can contribute** to digital products we make GitLab joyful to use. It is integrated and opinionated collaboration software. Because there is no need to string together multiple tools you spend less time, have less frustration, there is less [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), and you get more results.

2. To ensure that **everyone can contribute** with GitLab every person in the world should be able to afford it. Therefore GitLab CE is [free as in beer](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/). Also GitLab.com is free with private repos and CI runners, so that even without a budget you can use a great tool.

3. To ensure that **everyone can contribute** using GitLab in some form it should be free as in speech, that is why GitLab CE is MIT licensed. But open source is more than a license, that is why we actively help our competitor Perforce to ship GitLab as part of Perforce Helix. We try to be [a good steward of](https://about.gitlab.com/about/#stewardship) GitLab CE. We keep all our software open to inspection, modifications, enhancements, and suggestions.

4. To ensure that **everyone can contribute** to GitLab itself we actively welcome contributors. We do this by having quality code, tests, documentation, using popular frameworks, and offering a comprehensive GitLab Development Kit. We celebrate contributions by recognizing a Most Valuable Person (MVP) every month. We allow everyone to anticipate, propose, discuss, and contribute features by having everything on a public issue tracker. We ship a new version every month so contributions and feedback are visible fast. To contribute to open source software people must be empowered to learn programming. That is why we sponsor initiatives such as Rails Girls and lean poker.

5. To ensure that **everyone can contribute** to our organization we have open business processes that allow all team members to suggest improvements to our handbook. We hire remotely so everyone with an internet connection can come work for us and be judged on results, not presence in the office. We offer equal opportunity for every nationality. We are agnostic to location and that can be a real benefit to people in countries with less opportunities. We engage on Hacker News, Twitter, and our blog post comments. And we strive to take decisions guided by [our values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#values).

## Goals

1. Ensure that **everyone can contribute** in the 5 ways outlined above.

2. Become most used software for the software development lifecycle and collaboration on all digital content.

3. Complete our product vision of an [opinionated and integrated set of tools based on convention over configuration that offers superior user experience](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision).

4. Offer a sense of progress [in a supportive environment with smart colleagues](http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/10/dear-startup-genius-choosing-co-founders-burning-out-employees-and-lean-vs-fat-startups/).

5. Stay independent long term so we can preserve our values.

## Sequence <a name="sequence"></a>

1. Become the most popular solution on-premises (DONE)

2. Become the most revenue generation solution on-premises (through well executed marketing and sales)

3. Become the most popular SaaS solution for private repositories (through a great product that is [free forever](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/#why-gitlab-com-will-be-free-forever))

4. Become the most popular SaaS solution for public repositories (easier to overcome network effects if people already use GitLab.com for private repositories)

5. All knowledge workers contributing via GitLab (make GitLab much more user friendly)

## Assumptions

1. [Open source user benefits](http://buytaert.net/acquia-retrospective-2015): significant advantages over proprietary software because of its faster innovation, higher quality, freedom from vendor lock-in, greater security, and lower total cost of ownership.

2. [Open Source stewardship](https://about.gitlab.com/about/#stewardship): community comes first, and share the pie with competitors.

3. [Innersourcing](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/05/innersourcing-using-the-open-source-workflow-to-improve-collaboration-within-an-organization/) is needed and will force companies to choose one solution top-down.

4. Open Source model: openness, 10x better value, and help non-paying users.

5. Git will dominate the version control market in 2020.

6. An [integrated tool](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/developer-tools-why-it-s-hard-to-build-a-big-business-423436993f1c#.ie38a0cls) is superior to a collection of tools or a network of tools.

7. To be sustainable we need an open core model that includes a proprietary GitLab EE.

## Constraints

1. Founder control: vote & board majority so we can keep making long term decisions.

2. Independence: since we took financing, to prevent being acquired, we need to IPO.

3. Low burn: spend seed money like it is the last weâ€™ll raise, maintain 2 years of runway.

4. First time right: last to market so we get it right the first time, a fast follower with taste.

5. Low price: we must have low prices for EE since CE is an anchor and the delta is small.

6. Free SaaS: to make GitLab.com the most popular SaaS in 2020 it should be largely free.

7. Reach: go for a broad reach, no focus on business verticals or certain professions.

8. Speed: ship every change in the next release to maximize responsiveness and learning.

9. Life balance: we want people to stay with us long time, so time off is encouraged.

10. Values: make decisions based on [our values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#values), even if it is inconvenient.

## General 2016

1. Work with our [strategic alliances](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1-oAf0tMlTrAaPAsG_8NLXrI3DEZqI5ZA0gW0lKxFjA4/edit?usp=drive_web) to increase awareness and sales.

2. Partner with Rocket Chat, ship it with GitLab and integrate it.

3. Open up everything we can, including an [open Chef repo](https://dev.gitlab.org/cookbooks/chef-repo/issues/247), and open Asana.
