Have you ever wondered how GitLab employees use GitLab? Before I worked here, I always wondered how some products are used for their own creation. This actually has a name and it's called [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

Some months ago I went to an event in Facebook Headquarters and it called my attention that they use Facebook for everything, including registering guests and getting feedback. Most companies have certain technical departments that will work on making everything more “user friendly” or less technical for the rest of the company. In GitLab, we all try to learn how to use our platform and do everything that’s technical ourselves. That allows us to test our product and have more confidence on it.

## Using the website
To create or improve anything for our website, we have access to [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com) and we can add improvements and ideas there. We add Issues and Merge Requests for everything related to our public site. It is a public repository, so everybody can contribute to it (not only employees).

## dev.GitLab.com
We have a different platform for GitLab development. The idea is for our developers and team to work there. We have different projects for different purposes; Documentation, Organization, our different services, etc.

Once you become part of the GitLab team, you are granted access to the beta site dev.GitLab.com. At the beginning it’s a little bit confusing to be using both sites and knowing when to use each; but with time, it becomes more natural. I personally decided to customize each site with a different color so that it wouldn't be confusing anymore. We can use our beta site for tests and all of our version release actions. It is updated daily with the latest version, so that we are constantly testing it. Our new logo was tested there before it was released. We all agreed that it looked very nice.

## Our employee [Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)
Our onboarding is very simple and accessible for anyone. Since we are open source, it is public and once you become part of the team, you should read it and if you have any questions, you may use Slack to ask. It’s very simple and easy to use. If it’s written, I guess there’s no confusion.

## Communication
We use Slack for general information, emails for non-urgent information, and Issues for things that need to be improved or solved. We usually mention people and then we let someone assign issues to themselves. Improvements are added through Merge Requests.

Every year, there's an event that the entire team will attend. It's a great opportunity to integrate the team and get to know each other in person. This year, we are all going to [Oscon](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-eu-2015) in The Netherlands. It will be a great opportunity to interact and share some quality time with the team.

## Our call
Every morning in America and evening in Europe we have a team call. We start it with everybody saying in a few words what they did the day before, we go through a brief agenda and then everybody says what they’ll be working on that day or the next. Every call lasts less than 30 min. It’s efficient and it lets the team know important information.

So, how do you use the product at the company where you work at?
