We all have been greatly helped by Scrum and the [Agile manifesto]().
It freed us from waterfall planning and excessive process.
But remote working and continuous delivery need something more.

<!-- more -->

At GitLab we love to work remoto and 

We prosose the following 7 priciples for modern teams:

1. Everyone should have the freedom to work from where they want (be there for people, see more places, be happier without a commute, have less distractions)
1. Everyone should use asynchronous communication tools (use issue mentions and Slack, reduce task switching, end email overload, keep people in the loop, it is important that people working from the same location who can easily talk should not skimp on writing down, Business people should interact with the developers using the same tools
1. We recognize that nobody can look into the future (don't try to meet a commitment for the sake of it when information changed, features can be removed from a spring at any time, featues should ship when done, not when the sprint is done)
1. Face to face meetings can happen online (use a video chat (Hangouts, Skype) when you have something emotional to discuss)
1. Daily standups are for bonding, blockers and the future, not for reviewing the past (don't talk about what you did yesterday, this is not a reporting moment where everyone tries to look busy)
1. Do estimates on a need to know basis (if there is no estimate needed you shouldn't spend time on it, can be t-shirt sizes to determine if it is worth it)
1. Hanging out together in real life is worth it (spend time together, make sure to do more than just work, do a martial arts workshop together, visits the parents of an employee, go to a national festival together)
