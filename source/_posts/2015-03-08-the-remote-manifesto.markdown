We all have been greatly helped by Scrum and the [Agile manifesto]().
It freed us from waterfall planning and excessive process.
But remote working and continuous delivery need something more.

<!-- more -->

At GitLab we love to work remote and try to communicate as effectively as possible.

We propose the following 7 principles for modern teams:

## 1. Work from where you want

Working remote allows you to be there for you loved ones,
and be more available. It allows you to see more places, without ever having
to commute. On top of that, working remote removes (almost) all distractions.

## 2. Communicate Asynchronously

Don't try to mimic an office. Communicate using issue mentions and chat tools
(such as Slack). Reduce task switching and end email overload by using the
right channel according to the immediate necessity of someone's attention. Can
it wait a few minutes? Don't take someone from their work.

If people _are_ working from the same location, it is important that they do
not skimp on writing down things.

Everyone should use the same tools to communicate.

## 3. Recognize that the future is unknown

Ship stuff when it's done, not when the sprint (planning) is complete.

## 4. Have face-to-face meetings online

You should have as many face-to-face meetings as you would normally have.
The technology is readily available for any group of people and easy to use.
Some times it can be very helpful to talk, even if only a minute, when all
other communication is written.

### 5. Daily stand-up meetings are for bonding, blockers and the future

Don't talk about what you did yesterday,
this is not a reporting moment where everyone tries to look busy.
Rather, kickstart the day with some bonding,
solve anything blocking and share future plans so people can plan and act
and ultimately save time.

## 6. Estimate workload on a need-to-know basis

Don't try to estimate workload too much. This is mostly a waste of time
and usually inaccurate. If it's to get a general idea, use T-shirt sizes
for measure.

## 7. Bond in real life

Hanging out together in real life is awesome and totally worth it.
Spend time together and make sure to do more than just work.
Do a martial arts workshop together, visit the parents of an employee,
go to a festival together: have fun.

## 8. Give credits where due and say thanks

At GitLab we have a Slack channel `#thanks` for this purpose.
It always feels good to give and receive a thanks.
