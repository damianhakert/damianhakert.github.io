In GitLab, everything you do can be cross-linked and referenced.
This improves discoverability and reduces duplicate effort.

GitLab is more than just a Git repository manager.
There are a number of tools to help you collaborate with others, or even
just manage a project yourself.
The best features of GitLab help you link and reference related work.

 **Sign up for our webcast!** Find out more about making the most of GitLab to collaborate
 on your projects, join us for our GitLab Intro
 [webcast on GitLab Workflow][webcast], Thursday March 10th.

### Your issue is the Single Source of Truth

As mentioned in my previous post, [always start with an issue][start-issue].

This way you have everything you need to know about the issue in one place.
You can use [GitLab Flavored Markdown] to format content in the issue.

Later, as you make decisions, keep the Issue description updated as the "Single
Source of Truth" particularly when you hand off the issue and assign to someone else.
We use this as a [guideline in our own handbook about our workflow][ssot].

> When reassigning an issue, make sure that the issue body contains the
latest information. The issue body should be the single source of truth.

Link directly to comments to identify where you have made decisions.
The links will get formatted to be more readable.

### Referencing what's related

Add [references] in Issue or Merge request descriptions or in comments.
This will update the issue with info about anything related.

- To reference an issue: `#123`
- To reference a MR: `!123`
- To reference a snippet `$123`

You can make all the same [references] in comments or merge requests as you can
in an issue description.
For example relevant merge request, labels, milestones, etc.
We link everything together, so if you make references in comments, that will also
update the linked issue.

### Labels and milestones

Add [labels] for categorization.
Labels can have a description and a color.

Add a [milestone] to set a target date. A milestone is often used for releases,
but you can also use milestones to create a simple workflow.

The milestone view lets you see the status of issues at a glance, and
you can see the labels in this view.

### References in Commits and Code review

The purpose of the WIP MR (word in progress MR) is to encourage early code
review, share your work with others.
This way you can show your progress, and also reference related work.
Similar to references on MRs, you can add references in commit messages.

> `git commit -m "Awesome commit message (Fixes #21 and Closes group/otherproject#22)"`

"Commit often, but don't push every commit" said my colleague Patricio Cano
[in a blog post about Git tips][Patricio-tips].
When you push a commit, it appears in the activity feed, and it might be
a little too much noise for your colleagues.
Therefore, work on a number of commits, and then push to your branch
when you're ready to share your work.
Further details are in documentation for [GitLab Flow commit messages][glf-commit].

Your colleague can provide line by line code review.
You can also link directly to lines of code in comments.
Commits also have a comment thread available for discussion there.

### @Mention others and assign

This is a platform for collaborating.

You can mention people with @username and ask them to provide feedback in
MRs or issues.
As well, you should explicitly assign a Merge Request to someone.
In either case, the user will see a notice pop up on their [Todos] list.

In GitLab, assignment indicates who is working on and responsible for the issue
at that time.
Thereâ€™s always a single person responsible to work on a MR at one time.
Usually the person who is assigned to the MR is responsible for making any
amendments suggested in review.

We have a feature if you want to approve merge requests in EE, but there's one
person who presses the final merge button.

### What will this Merge Request resolve? Close issues automatically.

In the MR description write: Fixes #ID or Closes #ID.

![Close when the MR is merged](/images/blogimages/connect-relatedmr.png)

You can use all the collaborative tools we have at the point of a merge request.
So you can add all the same references, categorization, and comments that you
can in issues.

There's a key difference. Merge Requests generally resolve Issues.
When that MR gets merged, have it close your related issues directly.
This is another example of keeping the momentum going while you work.

GitLab will automatically merge that branch.
If you referenced issues with Closes #123 or Fixes #123 then the linked
issues will automatically get closed.

The point of *merge when build succeeds* is not only that it's a timesaver it
also helps keep your momentum going.
After merging you may want to turn your mind to the next project.
Or you may simply need a break!
You don't want to come back and have to remember to check and then merge,
and then have to remember to close related issues.

### Live tutorial: GitLab workflow

In our next webcast on March 10th, we'll dig into the GitLab workflow outlined
above, and you can ask questions live.
This will take you through the steps of making an issue, merge requests, and
using tools in GitLab for cross-referencing and keeping your issue tracker
organized with labels and milestones.
