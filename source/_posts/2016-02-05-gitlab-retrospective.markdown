The last 12 months at [GitLab](http://about.gitlab.com) were great.
Weâ€™ve put together an infographic detailing our growth.

We're excited about 2016!

Downloads of GitLab are up, and so are projects on GitLab.com.
To keep pace we've also grown the GitLab team.

We've included some details about our mascot, the Tanuki, a raccoon-dog from Japan.
Sometimes our mascot is confused for a fox.
But we think [2016](http://nymag.com/following/2016/01/everyones-crazy-about-this-japanese-raccoon-dog.html)
is
[the year of](http://mashable.com/2016/01/26/raccoon-dog/#5qybqogFK5qz) the
[Tanuki](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/27/travel/raccoon-dog-tanuki-named-tanu-feat/)
and hopefully you'll be seeing our Tanuki around more often!
