We added [GitLab Pages][docs-pages] in GitLab (EE) 8.3, and then added support
for custom domains and TLS certificates in GitLab (EE) 8.5. We made this service
freely available to users on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com), which is our hosted
GitLab EE service, offering unlimited and free public or private projects.

We've since added some great resources to help you get started.

## What you need to know about GitLab Pages

1. You can create a site for...

    - Your username

    - A group

2. You can use any static site generator.
3. You can connect custom domains and TLS certificates to secure your domains.
4. The service is completely free as part of GitLab.com

## New resources to learn how to use GitLab Pages

We added improved documentation to help you get your site set up.

- GitLab Pages Quick Start Guide: https://pages.gitlab.com
- Documentation: [GitLab Pages User guide][docs-pages]
- Documentation: [GitLab Pages Admin guide][docs-adminpages]

We also added a group with a number of example GitLab Pages projects.
You can easily get started with a [Plain HTML](https://gitlab.com/pages/plain-html)
site, but you can do much more.
The range of examples show that GitLab can support *any static site generator*.
You name the generator, you can build it with GitLab!.

- [Jekyll](https://gitlab.com/pages/jekyll)
- [Hugo](https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo)
- [Middleman](https://gitlab.com/pages/middleman)
- [Hexo](https://gitlab.com/pages/hexo)
- [Brunch](https://gitlab.com/pages/brunch)
- [Metalsmith](https://gitlab.com/pages/metalsmith)
- [Harp](https://gitlab.com/pages/harp)

All of this is made possible with GitLab CI. If you'd like to know more,
