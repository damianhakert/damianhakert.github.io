From January until March 2015 GitLab participated in the winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator.
We had an awesome time and want to thank the people at Y Combinator, the YC alumni and our fellow batchmates.
I'll try to explain why YC works so well, I think it is peer pressure.

Many people have posted about what makes YC work. ADD LINKS

Dinners, partners and workshops are great.

But peer pressure makes yc work.

Good founders do things better, you try to pull yourself up to their level.

YC is picky at the entrancebut inclusive at the end.
Make all companies look beautiful for demo day.
Instead of trying to pick winners (which is impossible).
Investors have two options, disbelieve it or try to invest in as many as possible.
And I wouldn't know a company in our batch I would short.

Picture of us in the house or at the car.
