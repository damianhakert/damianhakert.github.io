When I started here at GitLab in December 2015, I felt like I’d joined the cool-kid club. 
I’d heard about the job on HackerNews, and thought, “I’ll apply for it and it would be awesome if I got it.” And I got the job! 

It’s been a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to say we’re hiring two more front end developers. We have a unique challenge here at GitLab, working in a “open kitchen” together. We must serve both a great front end user experience and a great developer experience. 

If you’re curious about working at GitLab, read on.

## A veteran of the browser wars

I’m still a bit traumatized by the browser wars. I was writing Active X plugins and JavaScript for IE6. If you were there, you’ll know what I mean. Even now when I see “opacity” I think “Oh no!” I remember many arcane rules of when you could use one thing and not another. 

My job is twenty times easier now than it used to be. But I think many people have missed out. For example, a lot of people don’t pay attention to differences in browsers and testing nowadays. 

## What’s so different here

The big shocker for me coming to GitLab was that everybody is so involved in the plan to move things forward here. That’s unusual. Even in small companies there’s usually an “upper management divide.” They’re making decisions you’re not aware of. Things will change just one day, and you don’t know why. 

The team here at GitLab is very transparent. Everyone is working for the betterment of the product. Because it’s a small team, we pitch in on all kinds of tasks. It also means your skills improve. 

I didn’t know Ruby much before I applied for the job, and now I’m learning how GitLab works.  I don’t want to put people off, but you kind of have to dive into it. Having a good overview of how programming itself works is helpful. 

In the beginning I had a lot more questions, and people were really good about answering my them. Though I don’t know Ruby on Rails expertly, I now feel like I could build an application. This means I can troubleshoot better now. Once you submit a merge request, it should be top-notch because you work will be reviewed. 

## The Open Kitchen of Open Source

It’s great to work in a company where it looks good on the inside of the product as well as the outside.

It’s like a kitchen. There are some restaurants where, well, you don’t want to go back there. The front of house might be nice, but you don’t want to see that kitchen. All too often the quality of the code will lose out to the needs for a more elegant end user experience. Clients traditionally can’t see the elegance of the code. And they don’t care. 

Whereas at GitLab, developing open source software, we’re working in an open kitchen. It has to look as nice as the front of house. 

Open source front end developers must serve two user experiences. 

- UX - the front end user experience for the users who interact with the UI of the application.
- DX - the developer experience for the contributor who needs comprehensible code.

You’re dealing with stuff that is on the bleeding edge of development practices, and you’re doing it in a way that people can contribute. I want to be able to make a way of coding and working with GitLab that it will be both easier for users, and more accessible for contribution. We have quite a challenge ahead, and we need your help. 

## Want to join us?

I’m the first front end developer here at GitLab. I was most recently working for a digital agency developing applications and sites for large retail clients like Panera bread. You get tons of people to these sites and they have to work really well. The sites have to be fast and be extremely reliable. That is what I want to bring to GitLab. 

We’re hiring two more front end developers. If you’re curious, you can see a open issues and activity related to front end development at GitLab. 

In my interview with Job (Van der voort, VP of Product), we even worked through an issue. Job was honest with me. It’s all written basically in jQuery and coffeescript. However I think the code is timeless in a way. We need people who are really good at pure JavaScript, and don’t really care what framework we use. 

Some people are really dead set on particular frameworks. We can’t come in and rewrite this all at once. GitLab is released monthly. We need to move along at pace. We need to work on many small issues and at the same time think on a bigger scale of what we can do to reduce the code complexity. 

## We need to take it one step at a time.
