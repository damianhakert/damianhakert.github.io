We're delighted to announce GitLab Swag Shop is now opened!
We're starting with essentials: Some nifty t-shirts and stickers.

<!-- more -->

We know there's lots of love for GitLab, and we're delighted to hear
so many of you want to share your enthusiasm.

## Want to share your love for GitLab?

There's another way to get stickers too, meet us at an event
or come to a GitLab meetup.
Check out our [Community Meetup page](http://about.gitlab.com/community/meetups)
if you'd like to join or lead a meet-up in your local area.
We know people in our community would love to get together to
meet and talk about using GitLab, and all the ways you collaborate on code.

## Swag Portrait Contest Winners

We ran a contest over the holiday time to get a peek at how people
were using their stickers on laptops.
Thanks so much for sharing photos!

There's two lucky prizewinners who each won a t-shirt.

After looking at the entries, we decided that *everyone* should win a
prize for participating, so all participants will be getting GitLab stickers!

Looking at these laptops reminds me of seeing skateboards plastered in stickers.
It's cool to see how many different communities and projects people
are fans of! Thanks so much!
