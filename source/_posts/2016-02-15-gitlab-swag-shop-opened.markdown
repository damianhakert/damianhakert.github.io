We're delighted to announce GitLab Swag Shop is now opened!
We're starting with essentials: Some nifty t-shirts and stickers.

We know there's lots of love for GitLab, and we're delighted to hear
so many of you want to share your enthusiasm.

## Swag Portrait Contest Winners

We ran a contest over the holiday time to get a peek at how people
were using their stickers on laptops.
Thanks so much for sharing photos!

There's two lucky prizewinners who each won a t-shirt.

After looking at the entries, we decided that *everyone* should win a
prize for participating, so all participants will be getting GitLab stickers!
Again, please email us with a link to your tweet, claiming your prize. 

Looking at these laptops reminds me of seeing skateboards plastered in stickers.
It's cool to see how many different communities and projects people
are fans of! Thanks so much!
