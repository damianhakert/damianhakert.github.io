As some of you might know, I started working at GitLab B.V. in October of this year, making this almost my third month
with the company. What you don't know is how I managed to get here, how this time has been for me and how it has affected
my view on a lot of different subjects.

<!-- more -->

The journey to today started back in late September. I had just finished working on project that a Mexican Company hired
me to do remotely and was looking for my next challenge. A couple of days passed and I decided to update the GitLab
installation I use for personal projects, and out coincidence, or maybe fate, I landed at the Job Board of GitLab B.V..

Looking through their openings I saw one that spoke to me. _Service Engineer_. It really caught my attention that
they were looking for someone to work remotely from North or South America. At this point I said to myself

> Self, you are in South America! You should apply to this job.

Without thinking it twice, I gathered my resume and sent it to Sytse (You know Sytse, right? He is the one always lurking
in the comments. Oh, he is also our CEO).

Now is when the most exiting part started. I wasn't hoping for such a quick response, but Sytse answered my email within
2 days and, within 3, I was already talking to him. I never knew a job interview could be this easy and go this well. We
started talking about the regular stuff, _What working experience do you have?_ _Where did you study?_ _What did you
study?_, etc. After we got these formalities done, we started talking about what goals I have and how they would line up
with the company's goals. This is where I think fate intervened, our goals and core values lined up perfectly.

I was in a place where I wanted to learn as much as I could, to work for a young and fast moving company and I also wanted to
contribute to an open source project. I never thought I could find all these in a single company, but I did and within
two weeks I started working for one of the greatest open source companies out there.

When I got the call from Sytse that they wanted _me_ to work with them, I was ecstatic, and when I told my friends, some
some of them were kind of jealous (the good kind, not the green evil witch kind). I remember one of them telling me

> How did you manage that? You must be very good at what you do!

I felt extremely flattered.

Anyway, I'm digressing. I assume the real reason you have read this far is because you want the juicy details of how life
at GitLab B.V. really is. I know you might have read previous articles about how we work and how we want to achieve maximum
happiness within the team, but you have never heard it form the horse's mouth. Well, you're going to have to wait. (Queue evil laugh)

All this topics will be discussed on Part II. See you there!
