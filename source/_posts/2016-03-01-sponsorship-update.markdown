We’re so delighted with the interest in our [tech diversity sponsorship program](diversity).

Since we announced the program in early February, we've sponsored a number of great events.

<!-- more -->

- [Rails Girls Brussels](http://railsgirls.com/brussels) February 19-20, 2016
- [Rails Girls Tricity](http://railsgirls.com/tricity) March 5-6, 2016
- [Django Girls Florence](https://djangogirls.org/florence/) April 17, 2016
- [Django Girls Łódź](https://djangogirls.org/lodz/) Feb 27, 2016

## Rails Girls

Rails Girls is an important program for the Rails community.
Rails Girls aims to open up technology and make it more approachable for girls and women.
By sponsoring and volunteering at these events we can help grow the community,
but we get something out of it too.
These events help increase the potential pool of talent to work at GitLab.

Our colleagues Tomasz Maczukin and Grzegorz Bizon will be mentoring at the upcoming
Tricity Rails Girls at the end of this week. We have also invested as a Gold Sponsor in the
[Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/sponsors/).

Our GitLab CE project was accepted as a Rails Girls Summer of Code project.
We’re really excited to get involved.
If you have any questions please contact us about the project.
