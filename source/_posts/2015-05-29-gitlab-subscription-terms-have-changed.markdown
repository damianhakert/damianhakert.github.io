The GitLab subscription terms have been updated.
The terms have long been a bottleneck for our sales process.
Our open-core business model is different from a regular closed-source model, which generates extra work for the legal departments of our customers.
The original terms were unclear about our responsabilities, our handling of intellectual property, and how licensing worked.

<!-- more -->

Below the highlights for the most important changes:

1. Clear explanation that with the subscription, we offer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use GitLab Enterprise Edition;

2. Clarification that suggestions, feedback and code submitted for inclusion in GitLab, becomes the property of GitLab;

3. Clarification on the payment process, including the true-up payment model;

4. Inclusion of GitLab's warranty that they will not include any trojans or the like in GitLab EE;

5. A new paragraph relating to US government matters;

6. A change of the law of the agreement from the Netherlands, to California, USA.

The updated subscription terms do not apply retroactively.
