Have you ever wondered how GitLab employees use GitLab? It´s quite interesting since we use it to create for it. Before I worked here I always wondered how some products are used to create for them.

Some months ago I went to an event in Facebook Headquarters and it called my attention that they used Facebook for everything, including registering guests and getting feedback. Most companies have certain technical departments that will work on making everything more “user friendly” or less technical for the rest of the company. In GitLab, we all try to learn how to use our platform and do everything that’s technical ourselves.

1. Using the website
To create or improve anything for our website, we have access to gitlab.com and we can add improvements and ideas there. We add issues and merge requests for everything related to our public site.

2. dev.gitlab.com
We have a different platform for GitLab development. The idea is for our developers and team to work there. We have different projects for different purposes. Documentation, Organization, our different services, etc. Once you become part of the GitLab team, you are granted access to dev.gitlab.com. At the begining it’s a little bit confusing to be using both sites and when to use each, but with time it becomes natural. We can use our private site for tests and all of our version release actions and work. We are currently testing the new logo on our private platform. It looks very nice.

4. Our employee handbook
Our onboarding is very simple and accessible for anyone. Since we are open source, it is public and once you become part of the team, you should read it and if you have any questions, you may use Slack to ask. It’s very simple and easy to use. If it’s written, I guess there’s no confusion.

5. Communication
We use Slack for general information, emails for non-urgent information and issues for things that need to be improved or solved. We usually mention people and then let someone assign issues to themselves. Improvements are added through Merge Requests.

6. Our call
Every morning in America and evening in Europe we have a team call. We start it with everybody saying in a few words what they did the day before, we go through a brief agenda and then everybody says what they’ll be working on that day or the next day. Every call lasts less than 30 min. It’s efficient and lets the team know important information.

Now that there’s an office in San Francisco, we try to meet the team located here more often and we do things together. It’s a good excuse to interact and share some quality time. So, how do you use the product at the company where you work at?
