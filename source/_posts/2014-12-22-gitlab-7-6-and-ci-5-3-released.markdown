GitLab is open source software to collaborate on code.
Today we announce the release of a new version of GitLab Community Edition (CE) and GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE), with new features, usability and performance improvements, and bug fixes.

GitLab Community Edition now supports multiple Omniauth providers for a single user,
meaning you can link your accounts from Google, Twitter and others.

In addition to the updates from Community Edition, GitLab Enterprise Edition has gained **Audit Events**, **Rebasing** before a merge request and **Kerberos support**.

This month's Most Valuable Person ([MVP](https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/)) is ***MVP_USER*** ***CONTRIBUTION_OF_MVP_USER***.
Thanks ***MVP_USER_FIRST_NAME***!
