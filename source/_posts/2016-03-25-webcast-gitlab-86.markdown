In our latest webcast, we looked at highlights from GitLab 8.6.

Our special guest, [Douwe Maan](Douwe), gave us a live demo of the latest features
in [GitLab 8.6][releasenotes] with a special focus around improved confidentiality.
We looked at project configuration and user permissions to start.
Douwe followed a typical GitLab workflow for demonstrate new features
which make it easier to keep track of what is happening (subscribe to label)
and features which save you time (create a new branch from an issue), and more.

If you're new to GitLab, this webcast will give you a good overview of using GitLab,
and if you're experienced you get to see the new features in action.
