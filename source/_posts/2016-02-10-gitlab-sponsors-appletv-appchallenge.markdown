Gitlab is proud to participate in the Apple TV App Challenge! Apps are the future of TV, and AppLovin aims to cultivate the nascent tvOS dev community.

Got an idea for a tvOS app? Kick-start it by entering the Apple TV App Challenge,
hosted by AppLovin and proudly sponsored by Gitlab.
There are two ways to participate:
Either submit a full-featured app to the tvOS App Contest by March 31 or attend a 24-hour Hackathon April 16-17.

The best entries will be rewarded with awesome prizes, including $25,000 to the tvOS App Challenge winner and $5,000 to two Hackathon finalists.
On April 17, Challenge finalists will demo their apps for journalists, VCs, and other influencers (including Gitlab CEO Sid Sijbrandij!) during an App Challenge showcase.
