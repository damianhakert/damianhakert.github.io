GitLab acquires GitHost, a managed cloud service for GitLab

Today GitLab acquires GitHost, a provider of single tenant 'managed cloud' GitLab instances. GitHost is a great solution for people wanting to have a dedicated GitLab instance on their own domain name without the operational responsibility. You can also use it to run GitLab CI or to launch runners for GitLab CI.

In the coming months GitLab will add more features to GitHost, for example, it will no longer be needed to provide your own s3 bucket to perform backups.
