Earlier this summer we announced our seed round with funding from Khosla Ventures, 500 Startups, Crunchfund, Sound Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, FundersClub, Y Combinator, Michael Dell and other angel investors.

Today we are proud to announce our $4 million Series A funding led by Khosla Ventures.

GitLab will leverage the new funding to accelerate growth and scale its global
operations including development, marketing and sales. Additionally, GitLab announced
the upcoming release of GitLab 8.0, which is scheduled for release on September 22.
GitLab 8.0 will include 50 percent less disk usage, faster merging, Continuous Integration
(CI) with GitLab itself, improved interface and navigation, and 'Reply by email'
functionality that allows users to quickly comment on an issue from their mobile devices.

More than 100K companies and organizations currently use GitLab on premises including NASA, CERN, Alibaba,
SpaceX, O’Reilly, IBM and Expedia. These organizations and many individual contributors hack on,
contribute to and help GitLab become better every single day.

It is our goal to become the default solution for anyone building software and
working together. The excitement and passion of our community has convinced us
that open-source is the way forward. We want to accelerate our growth and expand
operations so we can reach more people and build an even better GitLab.

## GitLab, an Open-Source Company

Our three product offerings — a free, open source Community Edition, a free SaaS GitLab.com version,
and our Enterprise version – provide accessibility, full transparency, faster features, and stand as a
serious challenger to other Git platforms. GitLab features include:

  - Zero touch installation and upgrades;
  - GitHub, Bitbucket, Google Code, Gitorious importers
  - Two factor authentication
  - SAML and Kerberos authentication
  - Merge request approvers
  - Audit logging

With this new round of funding, we hope to provide more features, support, and expand to more companies and
organizations as the most popular and most trusted open source code collaboration platform.

After our Y Combinator experience and succesful seed round funding, we knew we wanted to go above and beyond what we
had done so farand make GitLab bigger and better for everyone, which is why we are working
with some amazing investors.

Vinod Khosla, founder and partner of Khosla Ventures said this about us:

> “Investing in GitLab was an obvious choice. Open source solutions are the future,
and GitLab is leading the way as the most popular open source code collaboration platform
on the market.”

> “GitLab’s reach in over 100K organizations validates that there is a very large market
demand for a more open solution that enables engineers to create, review, collaborate, and
accelerate the iterative process by deploying code that brings products to market faster.”

We're all very excited with this opportunity our investors have given us.
It means we can accelerate growth and scale our US operations, which
includes the recent opening of a new office in San Francisco (don't worry,
we're [still remote](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)!).

Sytse "Sid" Sijbrandij, our CEO said:

> “GitLab differentiates itself from other collaborative Git platforms because we are open source - [and always have been.](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/10/08/letter-from-shareholders/) Open source helps users to reach their goals faster with the transparency and control they expect from their tools.”

> “Our users choose GitLab because they can run it on their own servers, the source code is open and adaptable, and organizations can build on top of GitLab. We also have a loyal, vocal community of more than 800 contributors whose constant contributions help us roll out new features faster than anyone else on the market.”

## Thank you for believing in us

We'd like to thank our amazing community that has contributed major features,
bug fixes, documentation updates and more than we can ever return. We owe
GitLab's existence to your enthusiasm, drive and hard work. Without our contributors
belief in open source software, GitLab would be nowhere near where it is today.

Thank you to our team, that has been working hard every single day and feels
more like a highly distributed, international family than a company.
We especially like to thank the [core team](https://about.gitlab.com/core-team)
members that are not with GitLab Inc: Nihad Abbasov, Robert Schilling,
Hannes Rosenögger, Achilleas Pipinellis, Stan Hu, and Jeroen van Baarsen.

And thank you to our investors for giving us trust and support in achieving our
goals and vision.

It has been an amazing year of growth for us here at GitLab. It seems like just yesterday we
were dreaming of becoming a funded company, but it has been more than a year, and look
how far we're come. We're extremely excited and hopeful for the future of GitLab
as an amazing tool to build products, as a community, and as a company.
