We've just created and published our [Strategy document][strategy]
to make our choices clear as they relate to our strategic objectives.

<!-- more -->

Previously, we opened up our [roadmap](direction) and our entire [employee handbook](handbook).
We also outlined our dedication to being a [a good open source steward][stewardship].

Having our Strategy document in the open will help users understand why
we make certain choices at GitLab, Inc.
We can also be held accountable to these choices as well.

Our prime objective is to ensure everyone can contribute.
We outline our set of assumptions and the constraints under which we operate.
We include our tactical plans for 2016 for all aspects of our business.
We want to share this with the entire Gitlab community so you know how
and why important decisions are being made.

Often users are left wondering and speculating why companies do certain things.
We feel you have every right to know.
From whom we partner with and the investment burden we take on,
to the initiatives we support and the incentives we give our team:
All of these choices affect how GitLab operates and that, in turn, affects
your experience as a user.

Please do read our [Strategy document][strategy], and as always,
your feedback is welcomed.
