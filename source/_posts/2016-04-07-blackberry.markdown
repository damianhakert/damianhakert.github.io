In this post we'll look at how BlackBerry® is using GitLab.

## Background Info

BlackBerry® is securing a connected world, delivering innovative solutions
across the entire mobile ecosystem and beyond.
They secure the world’s most sensitive data across all end points – from cars
to smartphones – making the mobile-first enterprise vision a reality. 

## GitLab as an ideation tool

We spoke with Mark Chatterley, Senior Manager, Software Development at
BlackBerry about how they use GitLab. They run a GitLab instance as a center
for innovation, and use GitLab to support their ideation tool and Spark
(innovation) days. Mark explained it’s a place for developers to use when
they are experimenting and trying out new things. Anyone can create their own
repository and this makes it really easy for people in the organization to
collaborate. It’s really important to make the bar low for source code control
so that people get in the habit of always adding their source code to a managed system. 

They have about 1500 active developers using GitLab, located all over the globe.
LDAP integration is really important to help control access to this space which
is at once open and flexible, while also being secure and controlled. 

BlackBerry also uses GitLab as one part of productive development environment.
GitLab gives the developers a way to let them collaborate easily. They use the
JIRA integration and some projects also make use of Jenkins builds off their
GitLab projects and hooks to promote their applications to QA or production
environments. 

When choosing tools and platforms, BlackBerry prefers open source.
With open source, they are able to make changes and customize the tools as needed.
They also appreciate being able to contribute back. For example the Fork feature
was provided by BlackBerry´s team in [release 5.2.](https://about.gitlab.com/2013/05/22/gitlab-5-dot-2-released/)
Now with that feature integrated into GitLab, their customization is maintained
as a part of the core product. 

New ideas often start in GitLab, and may end up being maintained elsewhere.
They use other source code management tools, such as Gerrit, extensively.
Gerrit is a source code management tool that Google provided for Android - and
that is a natural fit for their work. When it’s time to move an innovation
project to production, the migration from GitLab to Gerrit is easy.
They aren’t locked in with GitLab. For BlackBerry, GitLab is an additional
incubator for innovation.
