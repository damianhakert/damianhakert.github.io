GitLab is growing fast. Day by day, more and more developers and users interact
with it. Over the past two years, the community around GitLab has thrived and
new contributors appear every day.

Although there are a lot of ways to [communicate][] with each other, we lack a
central place to discuss, without relying on third party applications.

Today we present you the [GitLab Community Forum][forum]. A new home to share,
ask and discuss everything related to GitLab!

<!-- more -->

The forum is run by community members whereas the hosting is gracefully donated
by GitLab B.V.. Remember that this is _not_ the place to expect any professional
help by GitLab developers, but to interact with the rest of the community.

## The platform

The platform that the forum is built, is the well known open source project
[Discourse][], a Rails + Emberjs application. It is a powerful app that is
used by many other communities, like Docker, Twitter, NewRelic and Mozilla.

You can sign up with a new account or use Mozilla persona to sign in. If there
is need to add another provider, please leave a reply to this post.

### Features

Discourse has this nice feature to use topics as wikis. As such, we migrated
the troubleshooting public wiki from [GitHub][] to [this topic][discoursetr]
Any registered member can edit it and add new troubleshooting tips. Having this
guide in the forum, gives us the power to leave replies under that topic and
discuss possible additions/deletions.

The search function is also very powerful. Îœake sure to use it any time you
have a question or stumbled upon something; someone else might already have
posted the solution. For example, searching for `reset admin`, reveals that
there is a reference in the Troubleshooting wiki.

## Forum structure

For better organization, we have added some [categories][] which you can choose
from, when starting a topic. If you feel your post falls under a category that
doesn't exist yet, you can report it [here][catreport].

When posting, you can use either bbcode or the well known markdown to format
your reply.

If you wrote a blog post about GitLab or found out an interesting tutorial that
helped you and you think it might help others, do share it in the [HowTo][]
category. Did you know that you can install GitLab on [Mac OSX][] or [FreeBSD][]
or even [Windows][]?

Little howtos, like how to give admin access to a person via the Rails console,
can go to the FAQ section.

If you have made a fan art about GitLab, share it in the Fan art category.

We also have an [ARM devices][armcat] category for any relevant information
about GitLab running on small devices.

At this time of writing, there isn't much content, so we expect you to start
contributing to the discussions! Spread the word and let the forum be the place
where we bond as community.

Happy posting!
