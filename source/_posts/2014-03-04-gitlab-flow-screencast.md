GitLab has a very powerful issue tracker that integrates completely with the GitLab workflow, allowing you to reference and even close issues with commits. On top of that, you can easily comment on someone's code line by line, integrate a CI service, reference others, vote for or against merge requests and much more. 
We are excited to show you some of the posibilities in our new screencast.
