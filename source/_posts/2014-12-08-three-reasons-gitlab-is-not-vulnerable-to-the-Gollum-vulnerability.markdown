Three days ago, Gollum, the git-powered wiki that is used in GitLab disclosed a
[vulnerability](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/913) that makes it possible to execute code on the
server that Gollum is running. Someone could exploit this to bring down your server or access your data.
**GitLab is not vulnerable for this, here's why:**

<!-- more -->

1. GitLab has implemented its own search and doesn't use Gollum's search.

2. For search, we made sure to use `Shellwords.shellescape(query)`.

3. Since GitLab 7.4, we switched to rugged, avoiding any use of grit [altogether](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab_git/blob/master/lib/gitlab_git/repository.rb#L194).

We've verified that GitLab installations prior to version 7.4 are **not** vulnerable
to the Gollum vulnerability either.

## 1 Tip

We recommend all developers to follow [our guidelines on shell commands](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/development/shell_commands.md) in the GitLab codebase.
As with everything in GitLab, if you see something that can be improved, please send us a merge request.
