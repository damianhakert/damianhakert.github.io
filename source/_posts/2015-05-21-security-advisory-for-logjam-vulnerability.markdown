title: Security advisory for Logjam vulnerability

A recently announced [Logjam vulnerability](https://weakdh.org/) allows an attacker to do a man-in-the-middle attack which will allow them downgrade TLS connection to 512bit DH parameters. More details on what that is and means can be [found on openssl blog](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/).

### Impact on GitLab

GitLab is using, by default, up-to-date SSL ciphers:

* `Export Cipher Suites` are not used.
* `Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman` ciphers are used
* By default, 1028-bit DH groups are used

This means that GitLab is safe in principle. When using 1028-bit DH groups there is a small chance that attacker with nation-state resources could be eavesdropping.

If you find this not sufficient for your GitLab installation, you can generate 2048-bit DH groups and enable `ssl_dhparam` option in NGINX config.

Params can be generated with:

```bash
openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048
```

After the `dhparams.pem` file has been generated you will need to tell Nginx where the file is located.

#### GitLab installations using omnibus-gitlab packages

*The section below is only packages version 7.11.0 and up.*

Place the `dhparams.pem` file in `/etc/gitlab/ssl/` directory.

In `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`, enable the following setting:

```ruby
nginx['ssl_dhparam'] = "/etc/gitlab/ssl/dhparams.pem"
```

and do `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.

More information can be [found in the documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/7-11-stable/doc/settings/nginx.md#using-custom-ssl-ciphers)

#### GitLab installations from source

Place the generated `dhparams.pem` in a suitable location, for example `/etc/nginx/ssl/dhparams.pem`.

In GitLab nginx config find `ssl_dhparam` config and set it to `ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparams.pem;`.

Reload your nginx config.

### Impact on GitLab.com

GitLab.com is using 1028-bit DH groups. Due to incompatibilities with older Java based clients we haven't enabled 2048-bit DH params yet as this would prevent people from using GitLab.com. We are looking into ways to keep a good SSLlabs score and allowing users with older Java clients to use GitLab.com.

We are examining the impact of this and we will update this blog post once we have more information.
