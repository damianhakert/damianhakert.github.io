We have released GitLab Enterprise Edition 7.4.4 that fixes a bug which causes a failing migration when updating from versions < 7.3.

We have also released new packages for Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, Debian 7, CentOS 6 and CentOS 7.

GitLab Enterprise Edition packages can be found in the subscribers repository.

Please contact us at support@gitlab.com if you have any questions.
