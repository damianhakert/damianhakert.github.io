At the start of this year, from January until March 2015, GitLab participated in the winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. We had an awesome time and want to thank the people at Y Combinator, the YC alumni and our fellow batch-mates.

This got me thinking about why it works so well. I think it's peer pressure.

The dinners, the partners and the workshops at YC are great,
but what makes companies thrive in YC is peer pressure.

Good founders do things better, you try to pull yourself up to their level.

YC is picky at the entrance but inclusive at the end.
Make all companies look beautiful for demo day.
Instead of trying to pick winners (which is impossible).
Investors have two options, disbelieve it or try to invest in as many as possible.
And I wouldn't know a company in our batch I would short.

Picture of us in the house or at the car.
