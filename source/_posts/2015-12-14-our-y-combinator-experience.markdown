At the start of this year, from January until March 2015, GitLab participated in the winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. We had an awesome time and want to thank the people at Y Combinator, the YC alumni and our fellow batch-mates.

## A clear focus

When you join Y Combinator, you’re put into a batch with a few other startups. This batch includes other founding teams and one or two mentors who are experienced in starting and running new companies. Every week you meet with the same people, discussing the same topics: 

- Where are you, 

- Where are you getting stuck, 

- How can we help you. 

These discussions are very concrete and not theoretical or philosophical. It’s all about what you are doing to get you towards your goal. They have clear targets throughout the program, which will vary from startup to startup, since they are all at different stages when they begin the program. Each founder or team has a clear aim to focus on one metric. 

Everything for the next couple of months is building towards a pitch at the final [Demo Day](https://www.ycombinator.com/demoday/). Demo Day is an invite-only event where each of the founding companies pitch to a group of investors.

This gave our team a clear focus, and with our product getting released every month, we had clear metrics to track against our actions. We went through a continual process of making our message clear and making our focus sharp. We focused on what we do, what we sell, and why we do it. We’ve kept that focus on growth and having clear communication and messaging since we completed Y Combinator. 

A quote from Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham which is [often repeated](http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-hacks-august-2-3-2014), encapsulates the Y Combinator experience: “Our goal is to give smart hackers an excuse to get together and spend time building something they find interesting.” For us it was just that: an excuse to work really hard on ONE thing together for three months with a strong focus.

## An excuse to work really hard - together

We started in the program at the beginning of 2015 with 9 founding members of GitLab. This group was mostly engineers with two sales people. 

Y Combinator require that the entire founding team including the CEO, [must live in the Bay Area during the program](https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/#p3). Y Combinator doesn’t assist with accommodation, so each company finds its own solution. This gives each company a way to forge their own approach and identity. We all moved over to live in the same house for three months. We found one small apartment with a living room smaller than my own home. We pushed all of our desks together and worked in that room for three months. 

It’s clear that the experience wouldn’t be the same without being there in person. It was as much about the access to the local network as it was about building relationships among our team. It was in that house that we started to develop our culture. We worked hard and built a strong camaraderie. We had a big car called “The Boat” to get around together. 

Towards the end of the program, I had to get ready to return back to the Netherlands for my wedding. At the last minute, we had a sudden opportunity to go see a major investor in LA, and we all bundled into The Boat to make our way there. After a little while I realized we weren’t going to LA afterall. We were on our way to Las Vegas for a few nights as a final send off before I was leaving to get married. It was a lot of fun, and one I’ll remember for a long time. 

Since Y Combinator we have kept up the same level of drive and focus. As we’ve built our team, we’re working on extending our culture with a concrete focus on next actions; and a focus on clear goals. We also established the [GitLab Summit](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/11/30/gitlab-summit-2015/) so we can have everyone under the same roof working together in person.  

## The network effect

There’s no question that this environment offers the participants huge advantages. You have a sense that everyone in the program is personally invested in your success. Considering YC take on 7% ownership, they are quite committed to your success. Beyond the direct mentorship, biggest benefit of having participated in Y Combinator is access to the network.

There’s a lot of experience available to you as a member of Y Combinator. They are very selective, choosing only what they feel are the most high-potential startups. Other founding teams in your batch are working on things that seem hard or impossible, it’s amazing to see what they are developing. They are also a diverse group with different backgrounds and skills. Other founders offer their direct help, without you having to ask for it. For example, they might make referrals and recommendations for key contacts. 

There’s a collegial atmosphere between the participating founders, and among the [YC alumni](https://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/#alumni). They often act as beta testers for one another’s software, or they offer technical help. We asked all Y Combinator companies in our batch to move to GitLab and we gave them an incentive. If some of the founders from other teams wanted to learn about our product, we invited them in and helped them set up in person. We took every opportunity to connect with other founders. The Y Combinator alumni from our batch still meet in person in California. 

Since Y Combinator we’ve given our investors monthly updates. The update follows a similar structure to those weekly conversations we used to have. We’re clear about our success and status; and we’re also transparent about where we’re blocked and where we need help. This makes it possible for those who are invested in our success to help us. 

Getting launched from Y Combinator pushes you ahead with huge momentum. It’s nice to look back at 2015 and consider how far we’ve come. We’re about to hire the 37th person on our team and our sales organization has come a long way. We went from 100k downloads at the end of Y Combinator to 250k downloads in November alone.

We constantly feel a great sense of gratitude for having been given the opportunity to participate in the program. Thank you to our colleagues and investors from Y Combinator and best wishes to everyone taking part in the next round.
