Fifteen months ago we [released](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/06/22/gitlab-7-dot-0-released/)
GitLab 7.0. Since then we've vastly improved performance of GitLab,
made GitLab work in any Enterprise through deep LDAP integration and
made it possible to [work with large files in Git](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/git_annex.html).
On top of that, the UI has been reworked and improved with every release,
GitLab CI has become a very powerful tool and we've made [hundreds of other improvements](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG).

We built this all as a community and by being [more](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/22/gitlab-7-11-released/)
[and more](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/08/03/almost-everything-we-do-is-now-open/) open.

Today, GitLab's next major version is here. And it's the best GitLab so far.
We're very excited that with GitLab 8.0 we're paving the way for the future.
It's faster, more beautiful and does more than any version that came before it.

The biggest new features in Community Edition are ***MAIN_CE_FEATURES***.
In addition to the updates from Community Edition, GitLab Enterprise Edition has gained ***MAIN_EE_FEATURES***.

This month's Most Valuable Person ([MVP](https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/)) is ***MVP_USER*** ***CONTRIBUTION_OF_MVP_USER***.
Thanks ***MVP_USER_FIRST_NAME***!

### Upgrade barometer


*** DESCRIBE HOW INVOLVED THE MIGRATIONS ARE. CAN USERS EXPECT MUCH DOWNTIME? ***
*** CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY MIGRATIONS THAT REMOVE OR CHANGE COLUMNS. ***
*** IF THERE ARE ONLY ADDITIONS OR NO MIGRATIONS CONFIRM THAT DEPLOY CAN BE WITHOUT DOWNTIME ****

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run
migrations, and start again, no matter how 'big' or 'small' the
upgrade is. The behaviour can be changed by adding a
[/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
