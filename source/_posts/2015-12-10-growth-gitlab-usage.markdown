We hear companies say things like "up and to the right" and "hypergrowth" but what does that actually mean? What metrics matter to companies to measure success and growth? We've been thinking about this lately and for GitLab, we've been measuring downloads, GitLab.com new users, revenue, and just about everything in between.

One key metric we watch closely is the number of downloads of GitLab. In November 2015, we saw 250,000 downloads of GitLab CE up from 31,000 in January of this year. This means we experiencing a 63% month over month increase. 

We've seen a year of extremely rapid growth for our downloads metric which we think qualifies as hypergrowth. Up and to the right!

We think this is a great sign of good things to come. Weâ€™re excited for 2016!

What metrics are you measuring? How do you define hypergrowth?
