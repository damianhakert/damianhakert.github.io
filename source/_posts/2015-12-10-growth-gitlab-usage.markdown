GitLab growth and adoption has shifted into hypergrowth, leading with a November 63% increase in month over month downloads.

GitLab usage is growing fast in a number of areas. For example we had [5k downloads of our Jenkins plugin per month](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gitlab+Plugin) and although the [GitHub one has 20k per month](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin), our growth line is much steeper.
