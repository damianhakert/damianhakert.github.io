One key metric we watch closely is the number of downloads of GitLab. In November 2015, we saw 250,000 downloads of GitLab CE up from 31,000 in January of this year. This means we experiencing a 63% month over month increase.

We think this is a great sign of good things to come. Weâ€™re excited for 2016!
