In our latest webcast, we highlighted the new features in [GitLab 8.5](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/02/22/gitlab-8-5-released/).
This was a really feature-packed release.

Job van der Voort gave a step-by-step tutorial of a workflow with GitLab.
This highlighted some of the new features in the context of collaboration.
If you're brand new to GitLab this is a quick introduction to how it works.
