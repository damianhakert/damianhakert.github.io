Today we are announcing a price change to GitLab Enterprise Edition. We have replaced the three subscription pricing plans (Basic, Standard and Plus) with just one plan. We have removed the seat minimums (formerly 10 for Basic and 100 for Standard and Plus) so you can purchase per seat.  The price will remain the same, $39/year/seat, the same price as the Basic Plan.  We will offer Premium Support; which includes 24x7 emergency support, live upgrade assistance and support for High Availability, as an add-on to a GitLab Enterprise Edition license.  The cost for Premium Support will be $9,900/year and $99 per seat over 100 seats, with a maximum charge of $35,000.

Why we are doing this?

* We want to enable people to order individual licenses so that if you need 2 you don't need to buy a pack of 10 or you need 104 you donâ€™t need to buy a pack of 200.
* We want to avoid raising the price of our basic package.
* We have more add-ons coming and we want to charge only the people that use them instead of raising the price for everyone.
* We wanted to charge more for 24/7 support.
* Our plus package was not selling well and we want to be able to customize the price based on the needs of the customer, you.

What does this mean for our current clients?

* We will honor all current contracts, until their renewal, providing them the support they signed up for.
* Existing clients can renew their subscription early and lock in old pricing by contacting sales@gitlab.com. Deadline for early renewals is April 30, 2016.
* Existing customers get 50% discount for first year of premium support.
* Current Plus subscribers get all add-on's, for FREE, while they are on the Plus plan.

Examples on what this may look like for you:

* Currently on Basic with 3 users goes from $390 to $117.
* Currently on Basic with 10 users stays the same, $390.
* Currently on Standard with 100 users that keeps premium goes from $4900 to $8850
* Currently on Standard with 110 users that keeps premium goes from $9800 to $9735
* Currently on Standard with 150 users that doesn't need premium goes from $9800 to $5850
