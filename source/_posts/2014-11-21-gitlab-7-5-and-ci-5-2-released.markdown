# Updating

Upgrade instructions for omnibus-gitlab packages can be found in [the omnibus-gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/update.md).

If you installed GitLab from source and you have version 6.4.2 or higher you can use the [upgrade script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/upgrader.md).
You have to update GitLab Shell to ***7.5.X*** manually, see [point 3 of the upgrade guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/X.x-to-x.x.md#3-update-gitlab-shell-and-its-config).

If you still want to do it manually - see the [Update Guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/X.x-to-X.x.md).

# Updating GitLab CI

*** use omnibus packages or the update guide ***

# Enterprise Edition

The mentioned EE only features and things like LDAP group support can be found in GitLab Enterprise Edition.
For a complete overview please have a look at the [feature list of GitLab EE](http://www.gitlab.com/gitlab-ee/).

Access to GitLab Enterprise Edition is included with a [subscription](http://www.gitlab.com/subscription/).
No time to upgrade GitLab yourself?
A subscription also entitles to our upgrade and installation services.
