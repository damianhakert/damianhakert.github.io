# Why CI?

[Continuous integration]() is a thing. More TK.

# Assumptions and environment

This post will provide a step-by-step guide to setting up GitLab CI for your iOS projects, from start to finish. First, however, we need to make a few assumptions.

[GitLab's strategy document](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/) hinges on one key idea: *everyone can contribute*. As such, this post is written for readers of nearly all levels of experience. However, given that CI is a relatively advanced topic, we're going to assume some basic knowledge of how to create Xcode and GitLab projects, as well as some familiarity with Terminal and git.

This post was written with the following development environment in mind:

- A Mac running OS X 10.11.3 "El Capitan"
- Xcode 7.2.1 and the iOS 9.2 SDK
- GitLab.com v8.5
