Improving diversity in tech has become an important issue around the Bay Area and New York in the last few years. Organizations and events tailored specifically for underrepresented groups are getting increasingly popular and it has been amazing to watch the progress in the tech world. While we aren’t completely on equal footing yet, there are many people making great strides. I’ve attended and helped organize many of these events and would like to help expand that reach to beyond the the major tech centers of the U.S.

In order to help to expand these initiatives, we’re offering $500 to any diversity in tech event located outside the New York and the Bay Area. In order to gain sponsorship, please email us at community@gitlab.com with the subject line “Diversity in tech” and details about your event with a link to registration or any supporting documentation. You can also review our [community sponsorship program and complete the form there](git push --set-upstream origin blog-sponsorship).

If your event is in a city where we have a GitLab team member, we’ll be happy to help coach or give a talk if possible. Check out our [team map](https://about.gitlab.com/team/) to see where we are. Just let us know where you are and we’ll see how we can help.

We’ve already sponsored [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/) events and [MeHackIt](http://mehackit.org/) and can’t wait to work with even more organizations globally.

Happy hacking!
