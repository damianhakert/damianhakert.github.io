**Please note that we have discovered an issue in the migrations in this patch
release. The tag migration will fail on certain duplicate tags in the database.

Please do not upgrade to 7.10.2 at this time.

If you have already updated to 7.10.2 and everything is working fine,
there is no need to worry. You can keep using GitLab normally.
