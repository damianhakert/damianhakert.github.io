# GitLab looked at the Fair Source license

At GitLab we have taken a close look at the [Fair Source license](https://fair.io/) to determine if it could apply to our situation.  We are very supportive of the Fair Source license and business model and believe that it will have broad acceptance into the market.

We evaluated the Fair Source license for use with our Enterprise offering.  In this case there could be an application of the Fair Use license - i.e. allow up to a certain number of users to use the product for free and then charging users once they exceed a threshold. We already have a CE version that is used by more than 100,000 organizations, in many cases  with thousands of users. Given that we already have a CE product, a free evaluation period and a free GitLab.com offering we felt that introducing yet another model for using GitLab would create too much confusion in the market.  

In other aspects of licensing we have embraced the principles of the Fair Source license through allowing users to modify and publish patch releases both as fully licensed customers which includes those users covered by an evaluation license.  We are open to suggestions on how we can do better on our [Enterprise Edition Source License](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/LICENSE).
