Today we released GitLab 7.12.1 (Community Edition, Enterprise Edition and
Continuous Integration). This is a bug fix release.

<!-- more -->

GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) 7.12.1 contain fixes
for integration with external issue trackers (e.g. Redmine), user removal and
SAML user activation. 

In GitLab Continuous Integration (CI) we fixed several bugs related to the new
`.gitlab-ci.yml` job specification format.

For more details on the changes please see the
[CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CHANGELOG),
[EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/CHANGELOG) and
[CI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/blob/master/CHANGELOG) CHANGELOGs.

Please see our [Update page](/update/) for update instructions.
