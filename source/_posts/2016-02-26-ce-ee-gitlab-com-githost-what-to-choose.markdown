If you're new to GitLab, you might be confused by the number of choices on [GitLab's main page](https://about.gitlab.com/): CE, EE, GitLab.com, GitHost.

It was confusing for me too. Some people even think that they had to register on GitLab.com to be able hosted version of GitLab. That is not correct.

GitLab has been started as an open-source git hosting, which you could download and install on your server.
As the time passed, GitLab evolved, and now has [much more to offer](https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/). This is why there are so many options.

## How to decide what to choose?

- If you just want Github-like experience, but with free private repos, just use [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
- If you prefer to control everything by yourself, then [install GitLab CE](https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/) on you personal server.
- If you need extra features & support for your large organization, then consider [purchasing GitLab EE license](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
- If you want to have your own instance of GitLab CE or EE, but don't want to deal with installation and upgrades, then you can buy GitLab hosting on [GitHost.io](http://GitHost.io)


Technically, GitLab offers two software products:

- **The Community Edition(CE)** - completely free open source version, where everybody can contribute
- **The Enterprise Edition(EE)** - more advanced paid version with extra features for big organizations.

And two ways to use them whithout manual installation:

- [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) - runs EE version for free for anybody
- [GitHost.io](http://GitHost.io) - lets you rent the instance with GitLab **CE** or **EE**
