One of our investors recently complimented us on our investor update email, 
and I wanted to share our template. 
It's straightforward and brief.

The general advice about investor update emails seems to focus on three main points: 

* *Send updates on a regular basis:* We've chosen to send monthly. 
This seems to be standard. 
[Jason Calcanis](http://calacanis.com/2015/01/23/why-investor-updates-are-really-really-important/) 
and [CodingVC](http://codingvc.com/investor-update-email-template) 
recommend sending monthly updates, because one month is a long time 
in the life of a startup.

* *Write consistently by using a template:* Using a template for the email 
will ensure you have some consistency, that you don’t miss out on any key points, 
and that your investors can scan quickly and make comparisons if needed.

* *Be specific with requests:* Be clear in asking for help. 
Unlike some other examples I've seen, we put our direct requests at the 
start of our email. Investor communications can be a great resource for 
solutions and advice. 
You can share the problems you’re having and make direct requests for help. 
Your investors want to help you to succeed. 

We've opted to keep our template brief and this forces us to be very focused 
in our updates. 

## What should you include?

What you include in your investor email and your own template is up for debate. 
Some templates look fairly long with up to 10 points. Some are shorter, 
like our template: with main information chunked. 

* Updates on metrics for comparison to previous months' performance. 
* Good news your investors can share. 
* Transparent information about low-points and challenges you're dealing with.

Some example templates advise you to include details such as "months of runway" 
or even product screenshots. 
Here are some guides and resources to help you prepare your own 
investor update email template.
