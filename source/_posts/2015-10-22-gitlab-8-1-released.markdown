With GitLab 8.0, we did our best to change everything for the better.
Today we bring you GitLab 8.1, which brings you more of everything.

The looks, feels, CI and features have all had updates major and minor.

This month's Most Valuable Person ([MVP](https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/)) is ***MVP_USER*** ***CONTRIBUTION_OF_MVP_USER***.
Thanks ***MVP_USER_FIRST_NAME***!

## GitLab = GL + CI

In GitLab 8.0 we integrated GitLab CI into GitLab, making it a single application
where you can collaborate on, test and deploy your code.

With GitLab 8.1, CI is everywhere.
You will find build status in the commit list view, in commits and on the front page
of your projects. You'll also find graphs of CI in the graphs view and a new
builds page for quick access to your project's builds.

### Upgrade barometer


*** DESCRIBE HOW INVOLVED THE MIGRATIONS ARE. CAN USERS EXPECT MUCH DOWNTIME? ***
*** CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY MIGRATIONS THAT REMOVE OR CHANGE COLUMNS. ***
*** IF THERE ARE ONLY ADDITIONS OR NO MIGRATIONS CONFIRM THAT DEPLOY CAN BE WITHOUT DOWNTIME ****

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
