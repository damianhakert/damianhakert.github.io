Today we are announcing a price change to GitLab Enterprise Edition.
We have replaced the three subscription pricing plans (Basic, Standard and Plus)
with just one plan.
Check out our [Pricing page][pricing] for more information, or read on for a summary.

### What has changed?

Previously, we had a minimum seat purchase, which required you to buy
10 seats for the Basic package and 100 seats for Standard and Plus.
Now we've removed the seat minimums so you can purchase a EE license per-seat.

The price per seat will remain the same, $39 per year per seat.
This is the same price as the Basic Plan.  

We will now offer Premium Support; which includes 24x7 emergency support,
live upgrade assistance and support for High Availability, as an add-on Option to a
GitLab Enterprise Edition license. Premium Support was previously part of our Standard Subscription.
The cost for Premium Support will be $9,900/year and $99 per seat over 100 seats,
with a maximum charge of $35,000.

### Why we are changing pricing now?

We're doing this for a number of reasons.

- We want to enable people to order individual licenses. Now, if you need 2
you don't need to buy a pack of 10 or if you need 104 you donâ€™t need to buy a pack of 200.
- We want to avoid raising the price of our basic package.
- We have more Enterprise Edition Options coming and we want to charge only the people that use
them instead of raising the price for everyone.
- We want to charge more for 24/7 support.
- Our plus package was not selling well and we want to be able to customize
the price based on the needs of the customer, you.

### What does this mean for our current clients?

- We will honor all current contracts, until their renewal, providing them the support they signed up for.
- Existing clients can renew their subscription early and lock in old
pricing by contacting sales@gitlab.com.
Deadline for early renewals is April 30, 2016.
- Existing customers get 50% discount for first year of premium support.
- Current Plus subscribers get all future Enterprise Edition Options, for FREE, while they are on the Plus plan.

### Examples of how this pricing might affect you
