Time to market is quickly becoming one of the most important, competitive factors 
for software development companies. However, the majority of development teams 
don't actually track cycle time, largely because there isn't an easy way to do it. 

*Cycle Analytics changes that.* It gives you the ability to measure how much time 
it takes to go from an idea to production so you can monitor and improve overall cycle time for continuous improvement.

**What Is Cycle Analytics?**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Cycle Analytics measures the time it takes to go from an idea to production for each project you have. 
Not only do we indicate the total time it takes to achieve this, but we also break this total time down 
into the multiple stages an idea has to pass through to be shipped. 
</div>

Reducing cycle time is the competitive advantage of the future. In fact, it's the 
first principle of [Conversational Development][convdev]. Few teams have cycle times 
of days, or hours, and yet the goal should be to reach maximum efficiency with a
[57 minute cycle time][tech-beacon]. The benefit of reducing cycle time is that you can ship quicker, smaller changes. 
This is not only more efficient, but helps teams be more customer-focused by being able to fix bugs and release new features, faster.

Cycle Analytics enables you to reduce your cycle time by helping you to identify which steps
in the modern development cycle are slowing down your team. Our [vision][vision] is to bring you all 10 steps of the modern development cycle into one UI. From idea to production, you should
be able to monitor the entire process in one place to help you move faster from idea to production. [Check out this video][demo] to learn more about our product vision.

**How Does Cycle Analytics Help Teams Work Better?**

It's easy to think that we are shipping quickly as a team, but issues can get stuck 
at a specific stage and easily fall between the cracks. Without metrics and a high-level 
overview of progress, we just don't know. 

Cycle Analytics is a way to prevent this from happening by giving you the data you 
need to make better decisions and work better as a team. With metrics to measure 
how long it takes your team to move from idea to production, you can pinpoint areas 
of improvement and more accurately predict your releases. Many teams already measure
a portion of their workflow, such as how long they spend writing code, but Cycle Analytics
allows you to see the entire flow from end-to-end, starting right at the idea stage. 

It's not enough to focus your coding on speed; what matters is how quickly you 
react to market and customer needs.

The first iteration of GitLab Cycle Analytics will be 
released on September 22, and is part of our [product vision][vision] to help you 
move faster from idea to production.
