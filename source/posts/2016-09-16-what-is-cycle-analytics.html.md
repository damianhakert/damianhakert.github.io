Time to market is quickly becoming one of the most important, competitive factors for software developers. However, the majority of development teams don't actually track cycle time, largely because there isn't an easy way to do it. 

Cycle Analytics changes that. It gives you the ability to measure how much time it takes to go from an idea to production so you can more accurately predict how long it will take to ship. The first iteration of GitLab Cycle Analytics will be released on September 22, and is part of our [product vision][vision] to help you move faster from idea to production.

**What Is Cycle Analytics?**

<div class="panel-body">
Cycle Analytics measures the time it takes to go from an idea to production for each project you have. Not only do we indicate the total time it takes to achieve this, but we also break this total time down into the multiple stages an idea has to pass through to be shipped.

**How Does Cycle Analytics Help Teams Work Better?**

<div class="panel-body">
It's easy to think that we are shipping quickly as a team, but issues can get stuck at a specific stage and easily fall between the cracks. Without metrics and a high level overview of progress, we just don't know. 

Cycle Analytics is a way to prevent this from happening by giving you the data you need to make better decisions and work better as a team. With metrics to measure how long it takes your team to move from idea to production, you can pinpoint ares of improvement and more accurately predict your releases.
