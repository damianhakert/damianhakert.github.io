In GitLab we believie that everyone can contribute. We also use automated
testing extensively to make contributing to GitLab easier.

Using automated testing is a great way to improve confidence when someone needs
to change the code, what actually is a case in the majority of contributions.

But how do we ensure that our test suite is good enough to aid the confidence
in changing behavior of software, and what can we do to keep on improving it?

# What is the code coverage?

## Why measuring code coverage can be useful?

### How to generate code coverage report?

#### Tools

#### Parallel builds

#### How we solved that?

### Using GitLab CI to generate code coverage report

#### CI configuration

#### Using build artifacts to store the coverage report

#### Deploy GitLab Pages with the coverage report

### Using code coverage report badge

### Summary

Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.
