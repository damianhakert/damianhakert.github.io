If it were appropriate to start a blog post with with every emoji
that expresses extreme delight we would. In lieu of that we will
just say the GitLab Summit in Mexico was beyond excellent. ðŸŽ‰

Six months of planning culminated in 201 GitLabbers taking over
one Cancun resort for a long week of meetings, activities, hard work,
and fun.

## We Took Cancun by Stormâ€¦

Our entire team was welcomed by the people behind the screens on Tuesday
with amazing swag, specially made for this trip, including a T-shirt,
name badge, stickers, bag patches, and a drawstring bag; all Mexican themed.

## Sid's Shuffle Challenge

After a full night's rest we kicked the week off with a welcome keynote
by our main man, [Sid], who immediately got the team spirit going by
challenging the team to make the Idea to Production demo work on
Google Container Engine.

If the team managed to show this fully functioning, he would do the
Sid shuffle from Ice Age 4. Needless to say our team didn't disappoint,
and neither did Sid.

## So Much Awesomeness

We broke into smaller groups for a competitive scavenger hunt and
enjoyed the fruits of our labor with a happy hour afterwards.

We could make this blogpost 5 pages long explaining how beautiful
our trip to Akumal beach was, where we got to snorkel with sea turtles,
how impressive the Maya ruins of Chichen Itza were after so many years,
the adrenaline rush the zipline gave us, or how much money we made at
our very own GitLab Casino night, but thereâ€™s no way of putting into
words how much fun this week was.

## Get Together Y'all

As always, the highlight of the trip was just getting to meet everyone.
The best thing about working at GitLab is the people. We have somehow
managed to collect the most dedicated, thoughtful, and hardworking group
of individuals around the world. Being in one place is exhausting, because
there are so many wonderful people to meet but also so inspiring. You get
to hear the diverse projects everyone is working on and their innovative
solutions and you feel inspired by his/her passion and creativity.
It made us so excited for 2017, knowing how much enthusiasm we are going
to bring and the potential we have to continue to build an excellent company
and product.
