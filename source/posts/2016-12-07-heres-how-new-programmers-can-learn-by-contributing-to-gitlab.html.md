Three years ago, [Eni Arinde](https://gitlab.com/elvongray) made a career choice that surely involved plenty of hand wringing and reflection. While living in Ibadan, Nigeria, he changed his aspirations from theoretical physics to software development, and began the long process of teaching himself PHP in isolation, with limited internet access. Here he shares a few tips for how new programmers can avoid the challenges he faced.

Learn more about his story and what he's learned below!

Teaching yourself is difficult, and I hope this motivates you to continue pushing towards your goals. If I could go back and talk to myself three years ago, these are few things I would tell myself.

### Find other programmers near you. 

I cannot overemphasize how really important this is. I always made the mistake of believing programming was something I could do on my own. You have to incorporate other perspectives, and you need to bounce ideas off people. Go to meetups, conferences and any events that will facilitate meeting with other developers. Try to work on projects with other deveopers, because most of your professional work will involve you and others collaborating on a project - it is very difficult to design and maintain complex software on your own! This can also help you avoid bad habits; it wasn’t until I got into a company that trained software developers to become professionals that I began to unlearn a lot of misconceptions I had learned. Even making small contributions to GitLab will help you get involved and practice communicating with others working on the same project. 

### Plan before you start coding. 

This is an important part of Software Development that lots of new programmers tend to ignore. Often we want to start writing code as soon as possible, but I have come to realize that skipping the planning stage has a negative effect in the long term. You’ll likely end up with an unmaintainable code base and a poorly designed application. You need to embrace the "boring parts" of software development. These help remind you to start small by mastering the basics before you try to build the next Facebook. [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas is an excellent resource. GitLab's issue board is a useful tool for thinking through potential challenges and creating detailed checklists. 

### Follow conventions and standards. 

There are some generally accepted coding conventions and standards you will come across when you start out. The advantage of following these norms is that most of them were created or developed by really smart people who discovered ways of making it easier to develop and maintain software. This will save you from falling into most mistakes others have found solutions to. That’s why it is really important to try and contribute to open source projects; they tend to expose you to these standards. GitLab has a [contribution guide]( https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to help you get started.  

### Document properly. 

This might seem trivial, but it is actually one of the most difficult aspects of Software Development. There is always a recurring joke of how naming things can be really difficult. It is important to document properly to ensure others can understand your code and make it possible for you to return back to your program after some time away from it without pulling your hair out. Young programmers tend to focus more on making their code run, ignoring their code readability. To avoid other people rewriting your code, ensure you document it properly, comment your code and use proper naming conventions. I read a funny quote in this blog [article](http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-for-violent-psychopaths/) that illustrates how important it is to document and follow best practices: “Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.” Especially since your work on GitLab will likely be public, you should assume that at some point in the future, someone will look through your code and perhaps even borrow from it.   

Almost anyone can learn how to code, but it takes tremendous effort to learn how to build complex software that can be maintained for years. It will be great if more experienced developers reading this article give feedback or add to the points given above in the comment section.
