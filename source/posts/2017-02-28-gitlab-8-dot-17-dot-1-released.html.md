Today we're releasing version 8.17.1 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and
Enterprise Edition (EE).

This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in the [recent 8.17
release](/2017/02/22/gitlab-8-17-released/).

If you're wondering what happened to the packages `8.17.1+(ce|ee).0` and
`8.17.1+(ce|ee).1`, good eye! The first version was accidentally packaged with
some Javascript tooling errors that we tried to fix in the `.1` version but
there was an error tagging the release. The correct packages are `8.17.1+ce.2`
and `8.17.1+ee.2` now.

Please read on for more details.

## Upgrade barometer

This version includes a migration that adds an index concurrently and should
not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
