## Upgrade barometer

This version includes a migration that adds an index concurrently and should
not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

Access to GitLab Enterprise Edition is included with a [subscription](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).
