Every business today is a technology business. Whether it supports your business model or itself _is_ the business model, your technology stack plays a key role. As hardware and cloud platforms are increasingly commoditized, software is becoming a key business differentiator in many industries that sets you apart from your competitors. If you are reading this, chances are that your business at least buys software as a service, or you are building that software yourself in-house. More than likely, you are doing some combination both. And so your software engineering team plays an extremely important part in your company. What they ship, and how they ship, has direct and measureable consequences to your business. Traditionally, engineers may have been shielded away from the "business parts" of the organization. In today's technology landscape, that's no longer a viable option. Fortunately however, maintaining _softwware code quality_ is a goal that good engineering teams have always strived for, and the good news is that that aligns closely with business goals, with caveats. In other words, software goals are business goals. If your engineering team can articulate the nuances of that simple truth in the context of your organization, and can help translate it into actionable business decisions, you will thrive in this business technology world today, whether you are a small feisty startup, or an established incumbent looking to continue your dominance.

## Software craftsmanship

[Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin) has pushed for increased professionalism in software development. He often likens it to other older professions like doctors or civl engineers. This idea of [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) is that a software engineer should be analogous, to say a civil engineer. A civil engineer is held to high standards from professional bodies and oaths. A civil engineer attaches their name to a bridge. And if god-forbid, it collapses and kills people, the engineer's name is forever tarnished. These are noble goals for software engineers, especially if you are building software to operate a [bascule bridge (draw bridge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bascule_bridge)! Unfortunately, they are challenged daily by business managers who may not know the intricate details of developing software. They want features to be completed and shipped yesterday. With this type of pressure and work environment, engineers are sometimes forced to deliver sub-par work, leading to high turnover.

In some organizations, business managers just want functionality in a product and service, and do not care about the underlying mess that may support it. They think that engineers trying to constantly clean up that mess is a waste of resources, and chalk it up to esoteric engineering goals. Engineers on the hand, want to always deliver and maintain quality work. They are less concerned about the business and the end users. This lack of communication and alignment creates distrust and ineffienciencies. It just doesn't work. 

## Code quality as a means to further your business

A better approach that more and more organizations (including GitLab) have embraced is lending a greater business voice to your engineering organization, and of course demanding greater responsbility. Have your engineering team communicate the benefits of maintain quality code, and why the costs of increased engineering resources (people and time, typically) are justified in tangible business outcomes (and if they can be quantified, even better). In particular, with higher code quality you are likely able to (along with good technology and business practices):

* Add new features quickly since the codebase is already clean and adaptable to change
* Remove existing features since it's relatively easy to identify which code contributes to those features, and which does not
* Change existing features, similar to above
* Have a more stable platform with fewer defects and security problems, again due to predictability of your code
* Deploy code quickly, reducing the time from decision to go live, since a clean codebase means there are less manual configuration steps required

Note that all the benefits above are _business benefits_! Your software engineers already know these are possible and goals that they themselves already aspire to achieve. For example, as a business manager or a product manager, you want to add new features quickly. So you should be asking how it's possible to achieve that. As a engineer manager, you may respond by saying that you need an extra week to update an existing framework that improves the _code quality_. And that the direct business benefit is that it will allow 50% reduction in feature development time for approximately the next 6 months. That tradeoff is a no-brainer in most consequences, and it's exactly that understanding and conversation that needs to happen for your business to succeed.

## Can you ever skimp on code quality?

In some organizations, you are shipping well-established and mature products. Likely the market cannot absorb shocks or big changes in the product. Performance, security, and privacy are very important, especially for highly regulated industries. In these scenarios, code quality is extremely crucial, if not just for the stability benefit outlined in the list above. Fortunately, these organizations typically may have more resources, and can more easily handle the increased cost of maintaining that code quality. Code quality should always be the rule, with very little exceptions. And engineering and business should communicate along those lines.

In a small startup or if you are in a large organization shipping a product quickly to compete, I'd argue that you can _and should_ skimp on code quality. Engineers may not be a fan when reading this. But this is the whole concept of _technical debt_ or _tech debt_. As an analogy, you take out a business loan so that you can take advantage of the crucial marketing timing right now to start a business. If you wait until you have the funds later instead, your competitor has already won. In the same way, sometimes a startup has to strategically incur tech debt to push out a product or feature update more quickly, to get the timing just right. If you instead choose to maintain that 100% quality code, you lose out on the opportunity, and don't even have a business in 2 months, totally defeating the purpose of you software development in the first place. You will have a beautiful codebase, but you will have lost your business. And so back in that business loan analogy, you have to eventually repay that loan. If you never pay it back, the interest will accumulate making the balance larger and larger. Colllections agencies will start banging on the front door of your office. Your business will eventually fold because of that unpaid debt. In the same way, tech debt only gets worse and compounds in complexity. Adding new features becomes extremely slow and your platform increases in defects if you don't pay it back. So just as any normal business always has some ongoing debt and knows how to balance it, an organization will always have some tech debt, and knows how to manage the amount of it, paying some of it back, and incurring new debt later, as the business needs arise. But again the key is that knowledge and understanding between the engineering and business teams.
