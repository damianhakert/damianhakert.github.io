Every business today is a digital business—every business today needs software. You may be buying it and using it as a service, or you may be building it yourself. Probably your organization has a combination of both, with some integrations. Whether you hail from a big or small organization, code quality is a chief concern, but how much you prioritize it over other real world pressures depends on your business goals.

When discussing code quality for now, let’s use a simple working definition that the more a software engineer cringes when looking at your codebase, the worse it is. It’s a banality to say that engineers should strive to produce high quality code, but they should also understand how their work affects larger business outcomes. Good code is not an end in itself, and understanding this simple point will help your engineering organization resolve conflicts and ship quality products. 

## What are the tradeoffs?

High quality code comes with benefits and some costs. It allows you to quickly build new features with a clean codebase, ensuring you can react quickly to the market by making changes to the product. You can change your codebase quickly as long as you also have a good deployment strategy, and your code is more stable and predictable, with fewer defects. The costs required to reap the benefits, however, are not insignificant. Additional engineering resources are needed to maintain the code quality, including continual refactoring and re-working existing code. This means your organization needs to hire or retain experienced engineers, with a high level of discipline and professionalism to maintain these high standards. 

## How should a big company think about code quality?

As a big company, you want a stable product, and to satisfy your customers. There is very little tolerance for error, especially in highly regulated industries. Security and performance are paramount, and to retain customers, you need to create new features at a steady pace

For big companies, the benefits of high quality code are clear. You probably have enough resources to support the costs/requirements, and you should lean toward code quality.

## How should a small company think about code quality?

In a small company, your long term goals are sometimes subverted by your everyday needs. You likely feel pressure to ship software quickly with new features, and you experiment in the market to get feedback quickly. Your constant, primary goal is to get new customers and revenue before you lose funding. 

For small companies, your engineering and product teams need to work closely together to make the best decisions. If you spend too much time maintaining a perfect codebase, your product might be too late to the market, and your business fails. If you spend too little time maintaining quality, your ship too quickly a broken product, with too many bugs. Furthermore, as you expand your product, making new features is increasingly difficult with a growing brittle codebase. 

You need to work in teams to understand if you want incur any tech debt to make a short-term gain, but be aware that you need to pay that debt back in the future before the debt grows into a huge problem. Remember, “debt” is exactly the right analogy to monetary debt. You take out a loan as an investment for now, but if you don’t pay it back, it will cause huge problems down the road. For small companies, you need to move not just fast, but be able to react quickly to market forces. A clean codebase helps with that, but it has to be balanced against your other immediate concerns.
