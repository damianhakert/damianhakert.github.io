A common misconception is that developer marketing is showing up at events and giving out
free t-shirts and stickers. While true, developers are humans and people like free t-shirts
it is not and cannot be the only method to your development marketing strategy, it's a whole lot more.

"But how do we market to developers?" is a question I've seen asked multiple times at multiple
organizations. Every company that's building tools for developers have at some point struggled on
how to properly market to their target audience. I've seen it at large organizations, I've seen
it at small organizations, and we've all seen product messaging doesn't quite fit what the product
actually does. Often times, that's due to a disconnect between marketing and engineering/product
and/or the marketing team not understanding how to message a developer product. While people are
quick to assume negative intentions of the marketing team, generally that isn't the case. It comes
down to messaging and communication between marketing and your engineering/product team. Developers
are awesome. Go talk to them.

Is it hard to market to developers? No, however, there's a big focus on truth in marketing, getting
a developer help fast when they need it, developer education, community, and making sure that your
marketing doesn't over-promise what the product is capable of doing.

The team has to balance how you market a developer product with the expectations of the developer using
that product. For example, most users of an developer tool will not expect an email from a demand generation
team or BDR team and they certainly will not expect a phone call.

So what do they expect? Developers will expect education, help getting started, tutorials, partner
integrations that make their lives easier, and truth in marketing. Developers want truth in marketing,
they want proper education, they want integrations that help them ,and they want the marketing team to
kind of stay out of the way while quietly sprinkling helpful information around the areas that they are interested in.

Some forums that developers use to get information are StackOverflow, Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter,
GitLab Documentation, GitHub, a basic Google search, and all of these things channels should be taken
into account when thinking about how to market a developer product. Where possible, try to offer community
support via these forums. Be responsive.  

For an event strategy, you need to not only think "how do I bring people together in a room that are using my
product" but also "how do I get feedback from that room" or "how do I make sure that conversations are happening
between GitLab team members and GitLab community members?". Use your event presence to talk to people that
love your product. Give engaging talks and make it easy to give feedback. "How do I make it clear that
feedback is appreciated?". You do that through saying, "Hey, I'd like feedback on this." Sometimes you
don't even have to say it and because a developer community is such an open and honest one in most cases,
feedback is easier to get. Make it easy to provide feedback, make it easy to become part of the community,
make it easy to contribute and people and developers will.

For a content strategy, much of the same applies. Education, tutorials, and making it really easy to get
started through blog posts, video, screencasts, office hours, webinars, etc.

In addition to the above mentioned tactics, good developer marketing strategy includes a great product.
If you have a great product, the job of marketing is much easier. Constant product and feature releases
are one of the best marketing tools. We are lucky that GitLab releases on the twenty-second of every month
and has since 2011. This show of momentum makes it much easier to market a developer when it's not stagnant.

In product releases, when your users can see that feedback from the community is taken seriously and put back
into the product, it says "we take our community seriously". Listen to the feedback, make it easy to give feedback
via issue trackers, Twitter, and/or Support and if it makes sense for the rest of the community to make a
requested update to the product, do it.
