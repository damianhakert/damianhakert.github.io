## Functional Group updates

Every day from Monday to Thursday, right before our [GitLab team call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call), a different Functional Group gives an [update](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/functional-group-updates/) to our team.
The format of these calls is simple and short where they can either give a presentation or quickly walk the team through their agenda.

## Recordings

All of the updates are recorded using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) at the time of the call. All the recordings will be uploaded to our Youtube account and made public, with the exception of the Sales and Finance updates.

Below are the recordings of the updates of this week and the week before. We aim to post a blog every week with the latest updates.
