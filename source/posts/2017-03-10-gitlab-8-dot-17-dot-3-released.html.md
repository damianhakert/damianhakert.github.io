## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
