<!-- beginning of the intro - leave it as is -->

Every day from Monday to Thursday, right before our [GitLab Team call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call), a different Functional Group gives an [update](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/functional-group-updates/) to our team.

The format of these calls is simple and short where they can either give a presentation or quickly walk the team through their agenda.

<!-- more -->

## Recordings

All of the updates are recorded using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) at the time of the call. All the recordings will be uploaded to our YouTube account and made public, with the exception of the Sales and Finance updates.
