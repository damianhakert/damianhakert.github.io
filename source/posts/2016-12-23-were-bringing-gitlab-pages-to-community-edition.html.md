Surely the dynamic community of GitLab felt inspired by the holiday-spirit you asked us to bring GitLab Pages from the Enterprise Edition (EE) to the Community Edition (CE) of GitLab.

GitLab Pages allows you to host static websites straight from GitLab, with any
kind of static site generator. For instance, my personal website is hosted
through GitLab Pages on GitLab.com using my favorite static site generator
Middleman with a template available in GitLab (as an example,
[see the source here][jobs-site]). Until today, GitLab Pages was exclusive to
the Enterprise Edition of GitLab.

When we chose to limit this functionality to EE, we did so based on the
reasoning that [small teams wouldn’t be interested in this
functionality][stewardship], strengthened by our belief
that these small teams also have the option of using GitLab.com (which runs EE)
for free.

Yet, [more than a hundred people voted][many-people] and discussed bringing
GitLab Pages to our open-source MIT-licensed Community Edition (CE). We’re
always willing to reconsider our decisions and the passionate messages we
received were more than enough reason to do so. Of course, for GitLab Inc. this
is also a business decision. When we decide to bring a feature from EE to CE,
this lowers the relative value of EE and therefore the potential of selling
subscriptions, which ultimately keep us employed.

**In this case, I’m happy to announce that we will be bringing GitLab Pages to
Community Edition.** We’ll do this at the earliest convenience, most likely
with GitLab 8.16 on January 22nd.

We’re very fortunate that our community is consistently being able to keep us
sharp. It’s our hope that even in the new year, you will continue to support,
guide, criticize and contribute to GitLab.

Happy holidays!
