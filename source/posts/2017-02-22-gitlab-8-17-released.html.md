## Squash and merge

We encourage all organizations to share their merge requests as soon as possible in [WIP form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/work_in_progress_merge_requests.html). 
Often this results in many commits as the merge request evolves. 
Developers often squash manually on their local machine before merging into the target the branch to clean up the commits.
With 8.17, you can now squash and merge with a single click, by simply selecting this option in the merge request.

## Streamlining project settings and navigation

We are continuing to streamline the project settings and navigation, which we [first started in 8.16](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/22/gitlab-8-16-released/).
We've combined the existing `Runners`, `Variables`, `Triggers`, and `CI/CD Pipelines` menu items into one simply called `CI/CD Pipelines`.
Navigating to `CI/CD Pipelines` will show you one page with all the settings that were previously spread across the 4 original pages.
