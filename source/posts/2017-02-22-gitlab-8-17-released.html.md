## Squash and merge

We encourage all organizations to share their merge requests as soon as possible in [WIP form](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/merge_requests/work_in_progress_merge_requests.html). 
Often this results in many commits as the merge request evolves. 
Developers often squash manually on their local machine before merging into the target the branch to clean up the commits.
With 8.17, you can now squash and merge with a single click, by simply selecting this option in the merge request.
