If you have a hard deadline, it makes sense to make sure the rest of your team 
has insight into when things are due. As of GitLab 8.7, we've made it easy to 
do just that.

If you've ever wanted to set a due date for an individual issue, now you can 
([!3614])! Adding a due date is a straightforward process -- simply navigate 
to an issue and assign it a due date from the sidebar.

Now, when you view your open issues you'll see the due date of each specific 
issue at a glance.

Please note that that this change only applies to individual issues and not 
milestones. 

We hope this new feature will allow you and your team to spend more time 
working and less time administrating your project. Enjoy!
