Today we are announcing the addition of a new enterprise plan, GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium. GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) Premium was built for global organizations who need a solution for remote teams, premium support, High Availability, and advanced workflow controls. GitLab EE Premium builds on top of our base enterprise plan and offers the following additional features:

* Premium Support: 4-hour response times, 24/7 emergency support, training, live upgrade assistance, and support for High Availability ensure that your team can focus on building great products.
* GitLab Geo: Make your remote teams more productive with read-only mirrors of your GitLab instance the signficantly reduce the time it takes to clone and fetch large repos.
* File Locking: Improve how you manage your binary and text files with the ability to lock any file or directory.
* Pivotal Tile: Easily deploy GitLab as a pre-configured appliance using Ops Manager (BOSH) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

GitLab EE Premium ensures your team has the tools and support they need today as well as in the future. Take a look at some of the Premium features we are considering on [our direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#new-products). GitLab EE Premium is now [available for purchase](https://about.gitlab.com/products/) for $199 per user per year.

## What has changed?

Previously, we had one enterprise plan and a number of additional products or services you could purchase as add-ons to your GitLab EE subscription. Now, the products and services we used to offer as additional purchases will be bundled into GitLab EE Premium. The only change to the former GitLab Enterprise Edition is the name. Its features and price will be exactly the same. This plan has simply been renamed to GitLab Enterprise Edition Starter.

We are also improving our Premium Support offering to speed up our non-emergency SLA from next-day responses to a 4-hour response time. This faster response time means that we will no longer offer a dedicated service engineer. While dedicated resources can potentially offer more personalized service, they limit our ability to get back to you as quickly as possible. We know your teamâ€™s time is sensitive so we chose to optimize for faster response times.

## Why are we changing pricing now?

GitLab was created as a tool for large organizations. As we work with more and more enterprise companies, we learn about their unique needs and work to adapt our product to support them. Over the last year, we released independent products and services that our enterprise customers could purchase to a specific challenge. However, thanks to customer feedback, we learned that rolling out individual products did not offer the best customer experience for two reasons. One, when a team needed two or more additional products their software bill would increase considerably. Two, when we released a new product that a team needed they would have to start a new internal purchasing process which can be a slow process at some companies.

We realized we could better meet the needs of enterprise teams with two Enterprise Edition plans. For smaller co-located development teams who need the additional security and workflow controls that our open source Community Edition does not offer, GitLab Enterprise Edition Starter is the best fit. For larger global organizations who need a solution for remote teams, faster support response times, High Availability, and advanced workflow controls, GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium is the best fit.

## What does this mean for existing enterprise customers?

* We will offer all enterprise customers a 25% discount for early renewal until January 31st, 2017.
* For customers who purchased one of the EE product add-ons, we will upgrade you to GitLab EE Premium so you can access the additional products and services for FREE until contract renewal.
* For customers with two or more of the EE product add-ons, we will include the additional products and services and update your contract to reflect the new EE Premium price of $199/per user.
