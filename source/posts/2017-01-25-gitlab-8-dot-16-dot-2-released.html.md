## Upgrade barometer

These versions have no migrations and should not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

Access to GitLab Enterprise Edition is included with a [subscription](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).
