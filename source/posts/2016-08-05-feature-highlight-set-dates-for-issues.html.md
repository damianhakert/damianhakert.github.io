If you have a hard deadline, it makes sense to make sure the rest of your team 
has insight into when things are due. It can be hard to manage projects where multiple teams are working on different facets of an application, but as of GitLab 8.7 we've made it easy to set due dates for issues and create milestones that incorporate multiple projects.

Setting due dates for issues is a straightforward process -- simply navigate 
to an issue and assign it a due date from the sidebar.

Now, when you view your open issues you'll see the due date of each specific 
issue at a glance.

Please note that that this change only applies to individual issues and not 
milestones.

Using milestones across multiple projects can help you manage all of the work your team and other teams are doing. Once you've created a group, creating milestones across your project is as simple as navigating to your group's "Milestones" page and adding projects to the list.

Once the milestone is created, you can add issues to it from any project. The milestone will also appear under each project's "Milestones" tab as if it were specific to that project. You can then view all issues across projects that are tied to that milestone.

At any time, you may also get an overview of a milestone's progress. This overview will show you how many issues are open, how many merge requests are open, and the percent of completion based off of completed tasks.

With these features, you and your team will be able to add more visibility into when projects will be completed and can easily break your scope of work down into more manageable chunks. Enjoy!
