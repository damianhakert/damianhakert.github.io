The world of software development is changing and time to market matters more now than ever before. The world's best companies are reducing cycle times to ship software at an incredible pace. In this brave new world, businesses that can iterate more quickly than their competitors will win. To help you stay competitive by moving faster from idea to production, [we are working][gitlab-scope] to bring you a product that mirrors the most natural and cohesive process for the way you do work--all in a single UI.

Following the [announcement][funding-post] of our $20M Series B funding lead by August Capital, we hosted a live event with our CEO [Sid Sijbrandij][sid-twitter] and MC [Jono Bacon][jono-twitter]. More than 1,000 GitLab community members attended to watch, ask questions, and contribute to the conversation. Within 12 hours of our funding announcement, **2,508 new projects** were added to GitLab. Thanks to our awesome community for your continued support!

<div class="panel panel-info">
**Building an Open Source Community**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Building great open source communities isn't easy; it's a patchwork of pieces that are glued together in a specific way to work. These pieces include everything from idea management (i.e. How do you get the best ideas to flow to the surface?) to code review and quailty assurance (QA). If these pieces aren't glued together properly, it causes frustration and complexity.

<div class="panel panel-success">
**GitLab's Evolution**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
GitLab started in 2011 as an open source project simply because "we wanted an open source git solution so we built GitLab," according to Dmitriy Zaporozhets, co-founder and CTO. Today, we've grown from a team of 2 to 104 team members spanning 33 countries. As of May 2016, we have over 1,000 contributors!

<div class="panel panel-gitlab">
**The Software Development Revolution** 
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
As the world of software development evolves, outdated processes like Waterfall, Scrum, and Agile aren't suitable for the modern developer. There are five factors driving this change: shifts in the market, changes in developer roles and the ways we communicate, an explosion of new tools, and the transformation of how modern teams work together to move faster and reduce cycle time.

<div class="panel panel-danger">
**What Is Cycle Time?**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Cycle time is the time it takes to move from idea to production.

To adapt to the emerging new world of software development, teams need to ship code faster. This is best accomplished by reducing the cycle time to 57 minutes by establishing cross-functional teams, automated testing, adopting infrastructure as code, and by removing hand-offs.

<div class="panel panel-danger">
**Conversational Development (ConvDev)**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
**5 Principles of Conversational Development
1. Reduce the cycle time to increase effectiveness
2. Monitor the process from idea to production
3. Thread the conversations through all stages
4. Gatekeepers become part of the conversation
5. The rest of the organization can contribute

Benefits of ConvDev
1. Shipping smaller and simpler changes is more efficient 
2. Frequent interactions gather more information 
3. Quicker to respond to market need
4. Higher predictability
5. Sense of progress

**GitLab Product Vision**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
There are ten steps in the modern development lifecycle. From idea to product developers need a tool that takes a strong, all-inclusive approach to the development process. We have product that supports 8 of the 10 steps and are working to ship the rest. We are also working on better integrations to GitLab a truely comprehensive package.
