Today we're releasing version 8.16.3 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and
Enterprise Edition (EE).

This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in the [recent 8.16
release](/2017/01/22/gitlab-8-16-released).

Please read on for more details.

UPDATE (2019-01-28): We've bumped the 8.16.3 Omnibus package version to fix a problem with
[bundler complaining about "Your home directory is not set properly"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1913).
For CE, you should check that version `8.16.3-ce.1` is installed instead of `8.16.3-ce.0`.
For EE, you should check that version `8.16.3-ee.1` is installed instead of `8.16.3-ee.0`.
You can upgrade from the .0 to .1 Omnibus version without any issues.

## Upgrade barometer

This version has no new migrations and should not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
