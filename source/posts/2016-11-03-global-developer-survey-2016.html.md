Technology trends move fast. In the time it takes to build a new program or 
feature, they very problem you're trying to solve can become obsolete. It's not 
just competitors you're worried about but the rapid pace of advancement in 
technology that can pit products within a single company against each other. 
Keep your head down too long on one project, and the rest of the development 
world has not only moved onto something new but they're using a brand new 
language and set of tools you've never head of to build it. Meanwhile, you're 
still coding in C++. 

This fact of rapid acceleration, or expotential growth, in the technology 
industry is nothing new. Moore's law predicted this phenomenon as early as 1965 
and over the last 35 years, we've all experienced the overwhelming shift in 
technology and digital devices. But what's surprising is there are still tons 
of massive development teams attemping to do revolutionary work at a 
revolutionary pace, using outdated systems and methods of software development. 
In an era where speed and time to market mattermost, technology companies are 
sabotaging their bottom line.

need for better collaboration as more technologies appear. Businesses need to iterate
faster to stay distruptive or risk being distrupted by existing or new competitors. 



2. Open source is the future & whu developers love Git. Developers have more choice in the tools they use and
prefer open source and Git. Latest technologies are important, some will even go 
as far to say they would not take a job if they didn't use the latest technologies.
