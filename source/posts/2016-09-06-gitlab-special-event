The world of software development is changing. 

[More companies are choosing to use open source infrastructures][black-duck-survey] due to the improved efficiency, interoperability, and innovation they can offer. Developers' roles are shifting away from specialized functions and moving toward project managing across the entire development process. 

These changes in the way we work demand an improved methodology that **puts conversations first**, facilitating better collaboration across the development lifecycle. 

The need to track the full path of development in a cohesive and intuitive way has already started to make room for new, modern development tools and practices that  foster collaboration and information sharing across the entire lifecycle of a project. 

At GitLab, our [vision][gitlab-vision] is to allow everyone to collaborate on all digital content so people can cooperate effectively and achieve better results, faster. It's our mission to make collaboration seamless so you can work faster, innovate better, and have more fun while doing it. We believe that to deliver more relevant functionality with higher quality, the amount of work per shipment needs to be reduced. To arrive at the same quantity you need to go faster from idea to production. To go faster you need to change from gatekeeping to enabling a conversation. 

This is why we’re excited to invite you to join us for a special event with GitLab’s CEO, Sid Sijbrandij. During this live event, Sid will share the future vision of GitLab Inc, CE, and EE, and the plan to build the new operating system for the modern developer using conversation driven development (CDD). 

Everyone is encouraged to tune in, ask questions, and learn how to contribute.
