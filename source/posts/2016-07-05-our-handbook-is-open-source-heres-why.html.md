In the past two years we’ve gone from a team of 10 people to a team of 90+,
and we’re remote-only. This represents a challenge in terms of recording and
disseminating policy and procedure.

In this post we’re explaining the reasons why having an open source Handbook
works for us, and how it can help you, whether you’re running a company of
your own, or maybe even thinking about joining GitLab.

## Remote-only communications 

We wanted something that was scalable for a growing company, and that simplified
onboarding for new hires in various countries. Since you can’t turn to the person
next to you, as you can in an office, and ask where a file is kept, we needed
something that everyone could access, no matter where they are.

Plus, we value results, transparency, sharing, efficiency, and collaboration.
With all that in mind, it just made sense that we would create an open source
company [Handbook]. Our Handbook is actually under a [Creative Commons][cc-by] license,
meaning that as long you attribute GitLab you’re free to copy and use it at will,
e.g., within your own organization. We welcome you to do that if you wish!
This way nobody has to reinvent the wheel.

Running a company out in the open isn’t the usual way,
and we want more people to be doing it. By putting our
Handbook out in the open, we’re making it easy for people to pick up on what
we’ve already learned, without having to start from square one. You can also
see how we achieved the current thinking, since you can see historical states and edits.

## Hiring

People considering a job will know what they’re getting into. Having an openly
available Handbook makes it pretty easy for people to learn about our company
culture and processes before they decide to work here. As part of the hiring
process, it makes things more efficient. 

> _Being able to get a look inside the company and not having to fully rely on the
representatives of the company makes you feel more confident—you don’t feel like
you’re being sold. I was able to think, Can I visualize myself working here? Does
everything I’m hearing from these people align with what I’m reading in the Handbook?
It could and it does.”_ - [Amara Nwaigwe], Senior Product Marketing Manager at GitLab.

## Transparency

Transparency keeps us honest. If we don’t want to publicize a company policy or practice,
that probably means it shouldn’t be part of of our company culture. Putting it all out
there ensures we keep our practices up to a high standard.

## WIP

It’s always a Work in Progress (WIP). We use the same procedures to change our Handbook as we do for
everything else, so changing a process = changing the Handbook. It’s totally simultaneous.
It’s also very easy to see how a process has changed by looking at the history of
merge requests associated with it.

## Efficiency

Everyone’s up to speed. Onboarding new hires — and onboarding everyone regarding new
policies — is time consuming, and someone is always left out. If time is tight, training
suffers. Having a living, open-source Handbook means that when changes are made, we all know.
Everyone is always up to speed on what has changed and why.
