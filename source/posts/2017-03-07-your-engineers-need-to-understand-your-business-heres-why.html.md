Every business today is a technology business. Whether it supports your business model or itself _is_ the business model, your technology stack plays a key role. As hardware and cloud platforms are increasingly commoditized, software is becoming a key business differentiator in many industries that sets you apart from your competitors. This shift has made engineering goals closer than ever to business goals, and understanding that will help companies thrive in the business technology world today.

If you're reading this, chances are that your business at least buys software as a service, or you are building that software yourself in-house. More than likely, you're doing some combination of both, so your software engineering team plays an extremely important part in your company. What they ship, and how they ship, has direct and measureable consequences for your business, even if they traditionally prefer to think otherwise.

## The noble ideal of software craftsmanship

[Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin) has pushed for increased professionalism in software development, often likening it to other professions like doctors or civil engineers. The idea of [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) dictates that a software engineer should be analogous to a civil engineer. A civil engineer is held to high standards from professional bodies and oaths; a civil engineer attaches their name to a bridge; if, god-forbid, it collapses and kills people, the engineer's name is forever tarnished. 

These are noble goals for software engineers, especially if you are building software to operate a [bascule bridge (draw bridge)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bascule_bridge)! Unfortunately, they are challenged daily by business managers who may not know the intricate details of developing software, and they want features to be completed and shipped yesterday. With this type of pressure and work environment, engineers are sometimes forced to deliver sub-par work, leading to high turnover.

In some organizations, business managers just want functionality in a product and service, and do not care about the underlying mess that may support it. They think that engineers trying to constantly clean up that mess is a waste of resources, and chalk it up to esoteric engineering goals. Engineers on the other hand, want to always deliver and maintain quality work. They are less concerned about the business and the end users. This lack of communication and alignment creates distrust and ineffienciencies—it just doesn't work. 

## Code quality as a means to further your business

A better approach that more and more organizations—including GitLab—have embraced is lending a greater business voice to your engineering organization, and of course demanding greater responsbility. Have your engineering team communicate the benefits of maintaining quality code, and why the costs of increased engineering resources (people and time, typically) are justified by tangible business outcomes. Along with a clean and adaptable codebase, quality code allows you to:

* Add new features quickly
* Remove existing features since it's relatively easy to identify which code contributes to those features, and which does not
* Change existing features, for reasons similar to above
* Have a more stable platform with fewer defects and security problems, again due to predictability of your code
* Deploy code quickly, with fewer manual configuration steps, reducing the time from decision to when you go live

Note that all the benefits above are _business benefits_! Your software engineers already know these are possible and goals that they themselves already aspire to achieve. For example, as a business or product manager, you want to add new features quickly, so you should be asking how it's possible to achieve that. As a engineering manager, you may respond by saying that you need an extra week to update an existing framework that improves the _code quality_, and the direct business benefit is that it will allow 50% reduction in feature development time for approximately the next 6 months. That tradeoff is a no-brainer in most cases, and it's exactly that understanding and conversation that needs to happen for your business to succeed.

## Can you ever skimp on code quality?

The short answer is: it depends on the company. In mature organizations, you are likely shipping well-established products. In these cases, often the market cannot absorb shocks or big changes in the product. Performance, security, and privacy are very important, especially for highly regulated industries. In these scenarios, code quality is crucial, if not just for the stability benefit outlined in the list above. Fortunately, these organizations typically have more resources, and can more easily handle the increased cost of maintaining that code quality. Code quality should always be the rule, with very little exceptions, and engineering and business should communicate along those lines.

In either a small startup or a large organization shipping a product quickly to compete, I'd argue that you can _and should_ skimp on code quality. Engineers may not be a fan when reading this, but this draws on the concept of _technical debt_ or _tech debt_. A bank loan is an apt analogy: You take out a business loan so that you can take advantage of the crucial marketing timing right now to start a business. If you wait until you have the funds later instead, your competitor has already won. In the same way, sometimes a startup has to strategically incur tech debt to push out a product or feature update more quickly, to get the timing just right. If you instead choose to maintain that 100% quality code, you lose out on the opportunity, and don't even have a business in 2 months, totally defeating the purpose of you software development in the first place. You'd have gained a beautiful codebase, but lost a viable business.

Just as any healthy business regularly pays back old debt and takes on new debt, your codebase should behave similarly. You need to clean up previously incurred tech debt so that a certain part or aspect of your codebase doesn't compound in complexity and defects, ultimately slowing down your business. But you should also continually analyze your business and take advantage of taking on new tech debt as the need arises. There is a lot of technical nuance to this delicate balance, and so your engineering team should be presenting the options and offering a strong recommendation. Your engineers need to be strong _business leaders_.

## Engineering goals are business goals

In the past, engineers were often removed from business discussions. Business managers established requirements, and threw those over the wall to engineering managers who would reciprocate with delivery timelines. In today's technology-driven business landscape, that's no longer a viable option for success. Both parties need to work closely together in order to survive in a competitive software world. Maintaining code quality is a great bridge in this effort, since engineers can easily articulate it's practical benefits that are easily translated into positive business outcomes. That is, code quality illustrates engineering goals are business goals.
