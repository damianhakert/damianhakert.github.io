Earlier in this series we talked about how [innersourcing][post-1] could
be the solution to common enterprise challenges, the benefits of
[releasing early and often][post-2], and the incredible efficiency of
[microservice architecture][post-3]. In this final post, I’d like to
share my thoughts on the exciting trend we see with open source practices
expanding across a variety of industries.

If you think you’ve been seeing increasingly more companies engage with
open source in the past year, you’re not wrong.

<!-- more -->

It turns out that as more companies get comfortable with the implications
around open source — letting go of control to the extent that collaboration
is more productive — open source is turning out to be an incredibly good
solution in a number of industries. In fact, according to this
[Open Source Survey][survay], in 2016, **78%** of companies were using some
form of open source software, and **65%** were contributing to open source projects.

There has been a shift toward open source across the board.
I think there are a few important reasons why it’s happening.
If the software fits these criteria, it’ll probably go open source:

**1. If a lot of people use it, open source just makes sense.**
{: .alert .alert-info}

Once you have a lot of people using a program, that becomes an opportunity
to crowdsource feedback and solutions from users, so going open source is
a shortcut to improvement.

Software that’s used by the majority of a large company, for example, is
likely to become open source, as is software that’s very popular within a
particular sector. More and more, enterprise infrastructure is becoming open
source, including networking programs, security scanning, ERP, etc.

**2. If a lot of international companies use it, open source makes even more sense.**
{: .alert .alert-info}

When there’s a software solution that can serve a lot of different needs,
and thus is adopted by a lot of different companies internationally, then
it will likely become open source. The same rule applies as above
(more users = shortcut to improvement), but broad international use
intensifies this effect, where having a strong reputation among developers
and the ability to facilitate collaborative development will drive interest
in open source. We saw this happen with, e.g., Linux.

**3. If it’s close to developers, it’ll become open source.**
{: .alert .alert-info}

Software that’s close to people who actually have the skill set to
improve on it is very likely to go open source. If a developer has
an issue with the software, they can scratch that itch and fix it,
bing-bang-boom: thus is the beauty of open source. Not surprisingly
this happens most often in verticals like development tooling. It
helps too that in verticals that are close to developers, decision
makers are likely to include those who understand the value of open
source, making it a faster leap.

Really, the only software that is likely to stay proprietary is something
that is used by very small or specific groups, and where data security has
to be handled in a particular way. This includes verticals like oil and
gas or healthcare. Although, even in healthcare open source is happening — it’s
just happening more slowly, and it may not affect everyone.
