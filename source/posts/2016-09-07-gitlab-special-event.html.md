The world of software development is changing.

[More companies are choosing to use open source infrastructures][black-duck-survey]
due to the improved efficiency, interoperability, and innovation they can offer.
Developers' roles are shifting away from specialized functions and moving toward
project managing across the entire development process. 

These changes in the way we work demand an improved methodology that **puts
conversations first**, facilitating better collaboration across the development lifecycle.

## GitLab vision

The need to track the full path of development in a cohesive and intuitive way has already
started to make room for new, modern development tools and practices that foster
collaboration and information sharing across the entire lifecycle of a project.

At GitLab, our [vision][gitlab-vision] is to allow everyone to collaborate on all
digital content so people can cooperate effectively and achieve better results,
faster. It's our mission to make collaboration seamless so you can work faster,
innovate better, and have more fun while doing it. We believe that to deliver
more relevant functionality with higher quality, the amount of work per shipment
needs to be reduced. To arrive at the same quantity you need to go [faster from idea
to production][post-ci-cd]. To go faster you need to change from gatekeeping to enabling a conversation.

This is why we’re excited to invite you to join us for a special event with
GitLab’s CEO, [Sid Sijbrandij]. During this live event, Sid will share the
future vision of GitLab and the plan to build the new operating
system for the modern developer using Conversation Driven Development (CDD).

Everyone is encouraged to tune in, ask questions, and learn how to contribute.

## Join us for the live event from anywhere
