{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

Let's start with a recipe for cooking a new lifestyle.

- In a pot, put some freedom to work from wherever you want
- Then, use a sieve to remove the stress of commuting every day for hours and hours
- Shake it for a while
- Then add some flight tickets to work remotely from somewhere else
- Don't forget to add some pictures of the adventures you live while traveling and working at the same time
- Add a couple liters of coffee
- Shake it again
- Now get it to the oven to cook for a while
- When ready, add the pleasure to work doing what you love
- Eat it like the best thing you ever tasted, and share it with your fellow team members

Yeah, that summarizes the awesomeness of working for GitLab. üôå

## First Things First

I first knew about GitLab when looking for a better option for my websites'
projects, at that time hosted on GitHub and served by GitHub Pages. I found GitLab by a Google search, and [signed up]() straight away. After exploring the platform for a while, I could perfectly understand what's what. I found a little difficult to set up GitLab CI for GitLab Pages for my blog project, which I imported from GitHub painlessly. After a few attempts and reading through the documentation, I figured out what I needed in my `.gitlab-ci.yml`. But I had some back and forwards until I got it sorted.

A couple weeks later, I saw on Twitter that GitLab had a program called "Community Writers", which offered compensation for technical blog posts interesting for its users. 
I have eleven years experience writing technically, so I thought it would be worth digging into this opportunity.

When I read the subjects GitLab had interest at that moment, I didn't see GitLab Pages in the list, but I'd love to write about it, once the resources for setting it up were limited, as I had noticed before. So, I sent an email to the person responsible for the Community Writers Program, asking her if there was any interest on this content. After a couple weeks, she replied telling me it would be awesome to publish a complete tutorial on setting up GitLab Pages with Static Site Generators.

That's how the story begins. üòÉ

## My First Community Blog Post

I started writing the post, and asking tons of questions on the opened issue and in the merge request, on how to do this, how to do that, what is it, what is that.

It turns out I got a lot of GitLab team members involved with my post: the Content Marketing Manager, the Tech Writer, a Developer Advocate, the CI Lead, and random people from the community popping up from everywhere. That was brilliant!! I loved it! When I saw that people actually cared about making it a better post, supporting my questions, and after that, documenting all the questions I had, I was thrilled with the QA level of GitLab, and the kindness of the team. That's when I realized I'd love to work for them in a daily basis.

Before publishing my post, the team improved the documentation, created a [webpage for GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io), and wrote a short post to launch it properly. I contributed to all of this, feeling astonished by the team work, and already feeling myself as part of the team. That was awesome!

## Knocking the Door

After publishing my first post, I already had several of suggestions for other posts to follow the first, and I was encouraged to keep writing as a community writer. So I did, but I was so involved that I ended up leaving my own stuff aside to dedicate myself to GitLab, in a natural course.

So I realized that perhaps would be a good time to knock the door. And so I did! I started to look for opening positions suitable for me, and couldn't find any perfect match. I read a lot about the company culture and the way things work in the [Handbook](/handbook/), and, the more I read, the more I liked!

Then, after reading [this post][XXX], I was sure that I really wanted that for myself.

I started to chat with the folks I had worked with on our GitLab Pages road, I told them I'd love to work full time with GitLab, and they put me in contact with the CMO. After two interviews, I got the door opened for me and joined the amazing Marketing Team. The onboarding process was very smooth and pleasant.

## Standing Still

> _Taking steps is easy, standing still is hard_

Whenever you start a new job, you need some time to adapt and learn, then the results start to come. Then you get feedback, adjust, and keep going.

GitLab is growing exponentially, and once in awhile we see big changes happening. Team members eventually come and go, new processes are created, old processes are deprecated. You keep moving, being flexible, adjusting and adapting to new situations. Not an easy thing to do, but necessary. Everything changes; it's up to you to change with everything or end up left behind. Some things shake us up, but we need to wipe the tears out and lift our heads up. If we keep doing a good job, the results keep coming, we overcome the challenges, and we are able to stand still.

## Remote Work

As at GitLab we're remote only, and our team is spread all over the world, so we work asynchronously. Doesn't matter where you are, or what is your timezone, we work at the time we want, since we produce results. Ship-ship-ship! Merge-merge-merge!

Normally, I work from Monday to Friday, from 11 am to 2 am, with 2 intervals of 1 and 3 hours each. I make my daily routine. There are folks that prefer working about 10-12 hours a day, from Monday to Thursday, and take Fridays off. There are the "normal" ones, who work during business hours, and there are the moms and dads that make their routine to match their kids' needs. They are able to work without loosing such special moments, like the first steps of a baby, or having them nested in their laps while in a team call.

Honestly, I think this is the kind of job of the future (hopefully!).

## Socializing

It's a serious mistake to think that because we're remote we don't care about each other and we don't interact in a more personal way. We do care, and, actually, we interact with each other sometimes more than in a non-remote company. Read through [Sean's posts][XXX], where he shares the story on how we communicate being remote.

When we finally meet someone in person, it's usually is a super exciting experience! We have a lot of fun together, and we just are happy to hangout with one another.

I first met my fellow team members in Rio. Robert and Douwe are doing their amazing 6 months trip, and they stopped by in Brazil to hangout with us. Me, Douglas, and Felipe worked together and had a lot of fun in Rio with the "gringos" (a slang for "foreigns")! Yay!

My second meeting with GitLabbers happened a couple weeks ago in Amsterdam, during the GitLab World Tour event. It was when I finally met Axil, our Tech Writer and docs master, with whom I work everyday, asking questions, making jokes, and speaking _PortuGreek_ whenever we have a lack of English understanding. üòú I also had an awesome time out with Emily and Richard, from whose I took a lot of important insights. Emily gave me the most famous socks in the world, and a couple other GitLab swag that we all love.

The event in Amsterdam was pretty special to me, once I had the pleasure to met not only quite a few GitLabbers, but GitLab users, customers, curious folks, and fans. It was very important to hear their stories, know what are they interested in, and what we can do to help. There's a lot of very interesting stories about them, which we'll share with you in the following weeks. Our community is awesome! Thank you all for hanging out with us in Amsterdam and in the other World Tour events as well. We ‚ù§Ô∏è  you!

## Working and Traveling

<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 no-pad-left">
After the event in Amsterdam I jumped into a short vacation, so I could visit my old friends in Dublin (where I'd lived before), and meet with friends in Prague. After my vacations I extended my trip for a week or so, to work and travel at the same time. Right now I'm writing this post aboard of a train from Prague to Budapest, working remotely in a Friday afternoon. üòé

Working and traveling at the same time is tricky, and you gotta be very organized. It's necessary to plan everything around having internet access. You need mobile internet, think about finding coffee shops and restaurants with good wi-fi, accommodation with good wi-fi and a table to work comfortably, and balance between a lot of work to do, and short time to enjoy the trip. It's impossible to stay online 100% of the time, so you gotta organize your workflow with the times you're working online and offline. Summarizing, it's an awesome experience, though a bit exhausting. It's something you can do here and there when you're remote only, not all the time. :)

## Wrapping Up

Now, six months after joining the team, and seven months after publishing my first community post, I'm the Community Writers lead and the Technical Editor of the GitLab Blog, as member of the Content Team.

I keep doing what I love, within a company culture that I love, with fellow team members that I love.

The best way to get a job at GitLab is simple: contribute! When you do, you can prove your value, present your work, know the team, and fall in love with GitLab - the company and the product.
