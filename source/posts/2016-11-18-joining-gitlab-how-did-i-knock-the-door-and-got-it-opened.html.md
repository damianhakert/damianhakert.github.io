I'm writing this post onboard of a train from Praha to Budapest, crossing three different countries in a couple hours. That's how remote working can be sometimes. \o/

Let's start with a "RECEITA" for cooking a new lifestyle.

- In a "pot", put some freedom to work from wherever you want
- Then, use a "penereira" to remove the stress of commuting every day for hours and hours
- Shake it for a while
- Then add some flight tickets to work remotely from somewhere else
- Don't forget to add some pictures of the adventures you live while traveling and working at the same time
- Add a couple liters of coffee
- Shake it again
- Now get it to the oven to cook for a while
- When ready, add the pleasure to work doing what you love
- Eat it like the best thing you ever tasted, share it with your fellow team members

Yeah, that summarizes the awesomeness of working for GitLab. üôå

## First Things First

I first knew about GitLab when looking for a better option for my websites'
projects, at that time hosted on GitHub and served by GitHub Pages. I found GitLab by a Google search, and [signed up]() straight away. After exploring the platform for a while, I could perfectly understand what's what. I found a little difficult to set up GitLab CI for GitLab Pages for my blog project, which I imported from GitHub painlessly. After a few attempts and reading through the documentation, I figured out what I needed in my `.gitlab-ci.yaml`. But I had some back and forwards until I got it sorted.

A couple months later, I saw on Twitter that GitLab had a program called "Community Writers", which offered compensation for technical blog posts interesting for its users. 
I have 11 years experience writing technically, so I thought it would be worth digging into this opportunity.

When I read the subjects GitLab had interest at that moment, I realized that I didn't have expertise enough to write about them, but I'd love to write about GitLab Pages, once the resources for setting it up were limited, as I had noticed before. So, I sent an email to the person responsible for the Community Writers Program, asking her if there was any interest on that content. After a couple weeks, she replied telling me it would be awesome to publish a complete tutorial on setting up GitLab Pages with Static Site Generators.

That's how the story begins. üòÉ

## My First Community Blog Post

All right, I started writing the post, and asking tons of questions on the opened issue and in the merge request, on how to do this, how to do that, what is it, what is that.

It turns out I got a lot of GitLab team members involved with my post: the Content Marketing Manager, the Tech Writer, a Developer Advocate, the CI Lead, and random people from the community popping up from everywhere. That was brilliant!! I loved it! When I saw that people actually cared about making it a better post, supporting my questions, and after that, documenting all the questions I had, I was thrilled with the QA level of GitLab, and the kindness of the team. That's when I realized I'd love to work for them, in a daily basis.

Before publishing my post, the team improved the documentation, created a webpage for GitLab Pages and wrote a simple article to launch it properly. I contributed to all of this, feeling astonished by the team work, and already feeling myself part of all of the team. That was awesome!

## Knocking the Door

After publishing my first post, I already had several of suggestions for other posts to follow the first, and I was encouraged to keep writing as a community writer. So I did, but I was so involved that I ended up leaving my own stuff aside to dedicate myself to GitLab, in a natural course.

So I realized that perhaps that would be a good time to knock the door. And so I did! I started to look for opening positions suitable for me, and couldn't find any perfect match. I read a lot about the company culture and the way things work in the [Handbook](/handbook/), and, as much as I read, more I liked the sound of that!

Then, after reading [this post][XXX], I was sure that I really wanted that for myself.

I started to chat with the folks I had worked with on our GitLab Pages road, I told them I'd love to work full time with GitLab; and they put me in contact with the CMO. After two interviews, I got the door opened for me and joined the amazing Marketing Team. The onboarding process was very smooth, painless, and pleasant.

## Standing Still

> Taking steps is easy, standing still is hard

Whenever you start a new job, you need some time to adapt and learn, then the results start to come. Then you get feedback, adjust, and keep going.

GitLab is growing exponentially, and once in awhile we see big changes happening. Team members eventually come and go, new processes are created, old processes are deprecated. You keep moving, being flexible, adjusting and adapting to new situations. Not an easy job, but a necessary one. Everything changes; it's up to you to change with everything or be left behind. Some things shake us up, but we need to wipe the tears out, let it pass, and lift our heads. If we keep doing a good job, the results keep coming, and we are able to stand still.

## Socializing

It's a serious mistake to think that because we're remote we don't care about each other and we don't interact in a more personal way. We do care, and, actually, we do that sometimes more that in a non-remote company. Read through [Sean's posts][XXX], where he shares the story on how we communicate being remote.

When we finally meet someone in person, it's usually is a super exciting experience: we hug each other, we cheer up, we are surprised how tall people really look like (you can't believe how tall they are!), we have a lot of fun together, and we just are happy to hangout with one another. 

I first met my fellow team members in Rio. Robert and Douwe are doing their amazing 6 months trip, and they stopped by in Brazil to hangout with us. Me, Douglas, and Felipe worked together and had a lot of fun with the "gringos" in Rio! Yay! 

My second meeting with GitLabbers happened a couple weeks ago in Amsterdam, during the GitLab World Tour event. It was when I finally met Axil, our Tech Writer and docs master, with whom I work everyday, asking questions, making jokes, and speaking Portugreek whenever we have a lack of English words. üòú I also had an awesome time out with Emily "1.0" and Richard "Pidge", from which I took a lot of important insights. Emily gave me the most famous socks in the world, and a couple other GitLab swag that we all love.

The event in Amsterdam was pretty special to me, once I had the pleasure to met not only GitLabbers, but GitLab users, customers, curious folks, and fans. It was very important to hear their stories, know what are they interested in, and what we can do to help. There's a lot of very interesting stories about them, which we'll share with you in the following weeks. Our community is awesome! Thank you all for hanging out with us in Amsterdam and in the other World Tour events as well. We ‚ù§Ô∏è you!

After the event I jumped into a short vacation, so I could visit my old friends in Dublin (where I'd lived before), and meet another friend in Praha. Right now I'm writing this post onboard of a train from Praha to Budapest, working remotely in a Friday afternoon. üòé 

Next week I'll go back home in Brazil, and chill out until January, when we're having our Summit Meeting. It happens once every 6 to 9 months, and it's when we have the opportunity to see all the team members in person! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Wrapping Up

Now, six months after joining the team, and seven months after publishing my first community post, I'm the Community Writers lead and the Technical Editor of the GitLab Blog, as member of the Content Team.

I keep doing what I love, with a company culture that I love, with fellow colleagues that I love. And that's us!

The thing to get a job at GitLab is simple: contribute! When you do, you can prove your value, present your work, know the team, and fall in love with GitLab - the company and the product.

Join us! There are several positions opened! üôå
