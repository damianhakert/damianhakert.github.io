### How to Prepare for a Virtual Interview

The GitLab interview process, like our company, is remote first. As a result, our recruiting team and
hiring managers  spend lots of time meeting candidates via [video calls](/handbook/#videocalls). Video chats are an important part
of our daily culture and a great way to connect with our teammates, but they can also be a confusing, uncomfortable,
and stress-inducing component of an interview. To combat the video chat nerves, we’ve created simple steps to help prepare you for
your interview with GitLab!

## Stage Your Interview Spot
It’s nice to be in a neutral environment that is a quiet and comfortable for you. That way neither you
nor the interview gets too distracted by your environment. We encourage you to display your [quirkiness](/handbook/#values) and personality, but for the interview it's best to avoid chaos.
We wouldn't suggest taking your interview call in a loud crowded cafe, in a car, or from your bed!
These examples may sound extreme, but we have seen it all.

## Practice Your Positioning
During the interview you can’t exactly make eye contact with the interviewer, so the interviewer should clearly be
able to see your face. Before the interview, check your front facing camera/webcam to make sure you are well
lit and can be seen!

## Test Your Tech
Nothing is worse than realizing moments before your call that you don’t have strong enough wifi, don’t know
how to use the video platform, or can’t get your mic to work! Test your equipment and the video platform before
your interview, and avoid technical snags the day of! It’s also worthwhile to make sure your computers are fully charged
or plugged in, and you have earphones with a good mic (this helps minimize echo.) We suggest using a webcam or your built-in
camera on your laptop for the interview instead of using a phone or tablet.

## Be (Very) Prepared
Prepare for a virtual interview the same way you would for an in-person interview. Just because you are taking a
call from home doesn’t make it the same as a casual call. Dress appropriately, do your research, and prepare good questions.
At GitLab, we love when candidates have reviewed our [handbook](/handbook) and know our [values](/handbook/#values).
Many of our [interview questions](/handbook/hiring/#interview-questions) can even be found in our [hiring process](/handbook/hiring), making preparation simple.
Making a great first impression is not reserved for on-site interviews.

More and more organizations are conducting interviews and meetings using video platforms. At GitLab we use Google Hangouts or Appear.in
for most of our [one-on-one calls](/handbook/#video-calls). Whatever platform you’re using, these simple guidelines will
help you have the most productive web interview allowing you to focus on the role.

**So what are you waiting for?** Now that you’re ready for your first interview with GitLab, head to our [jobs page](/jobs) to
check out all of our open roles. We can’t wait to meet you!
