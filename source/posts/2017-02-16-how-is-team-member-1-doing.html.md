The person that gave the unfortunate command to [delete our primary database](/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/) was not only on our minds but also of other people.

During and after the DB incident, we received notes from our community asking how was _team-member-1_ doing. We're here to tell you that.

We were all really touched by the love our community sent us via [#HugOps](https://twitter.com/i/moments/826818668948549632):

### Support

The support our engineers received from our community was fantastic, people were appreciative of our [transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/) in working on the solution. Even teams from other companies, who had been in that situation themselves, showed their support.

### Gifts

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

The Cole Fresh team brought cookies to our HQ in San Francisco with a card saying:

> _Hey GitLab, We thought you could use a chance to destress a little. Don't sweat it we're rooting for you. We've all been there before and we have a lot of faith in you to work it out. You got THIS! From Dan, and the Cole Fresh Team_

A group from Google came to our HQ and got our engineers $300 to spend on something to make them feel better after all of this was over:

> _Yay for you! We've all been there! :) From friends of yours at Google_

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 center-block">

❤️ &nbsp;**Thank you Cole Fresh and Google!**&nbsp; ❤️
{: .alert .alert-gitlab-purple .text-center}

The engineers involved have agreed that this extremely generous gift from Google will be spent on sponsoring Rails Girls events. But the cookies were obviously eaten by the one who grabbed the pack! 😛

At GitLab we're very proud of this initiative and will get the engineers involved matching swag for their next livestream event and will enjoy some team bonding fun soon.

Needless to say, some special thank you swag is on it's way to these amazing people that took the time to come to our office and try to help us feel a bit better.

## GitLab Values

At GitLab we think that the people making the most mistakes frequently correlate with the people doing the most work. I certainly make a lot of mistakes every day. It is important not to double down on them but to acknowledge them and learn from it.

We make mistakes. What's different from person to person, organization to organization, is how to deal with them. What we [value](/handbook/values/) most at GitLab is:

> - _**Transparency**: "Don't be afraid to admit you made a mistake or were wrong. When something went wrong it is a great opportunity to say 'What’s the kaizen moment here?' and find a better way without hurt feelings."_
- _**Collaboration**: "Say sorry if you made a mistake apologize. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most will likely make the most mistakes."_
- _**Behaviour**:_
  - _Be truthful and honest._
  - _Be dependable, reliable, fair, and respectful._
  - _Be committed, creative, inspiring, and passionate._

### Transparency

How could we value transparency if our team members were afraid of assuming their mistakes?

> _It is not our intent to have one of our team members implicated by the transparency. (...) We are very aware of the stress that such a mistake might cause and the rest of the team has been very supportive. (...) We recognize the risk to the company of being transparent, but your values are defined by what you do when it is hard._ [Sytse, CEO](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13622645).

People expressed a lot of appreciation for our transparency:

## Team-member-1

While we were putting the fire out, we received this comment:

> _The GitLab engineer (team-member-1) is one of the smartest people he's ever known - in fact, he's actually brilliant. So you can rest assured that the data loss wasn't caused by a an inexperienced kid._ ([Ref](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13621016))

And this thoughtful tweet:

<div class="center">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pray for team-member-1 <a href="https://t.co/foQcWm0WJH">pic.twitter.com/foQcWm0WJH</a></p>&mdash; Rubén Fernández (@_rubenfa) <a href="https://twitter.com/_rubenfa/status/826785807495213058">February 1, 2017</a></blockquote>
</div>

We heard you Rubén! :)

_Team-member-1_ [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13620178):

> _Still here, and doing just fine._

Yes, _team-member-1_ is doing very well! 

Coincidentally, just before the DB incident, _team-member-1_ had qualified for a promotion to senior developer. The outage did not change that decision.

> _Promotions are to be based on meeting the criteria of the role the individual is to be promoted in to (i.e. promote based on performance)_ - [GitLab PeopleOps Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#promotions)

When we promote people at GitLab, or give a them a [bonus](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives/#discretionary-bonuses), we share the reasons for that with the whole company. With the permission of _team-member-1_, this blog post is both the internal and external announcement of that promotion.

### We support each other

For those developers involved in the outage, we made a special T-shirt:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 center-block">
![T-shirt front](/images/blogimages/how-is-team-member-1-doing/tshirt-front.png){: .center-block}
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 center-block">
![T-shirt back](/images/blogimages/how-is-team-member-1-doing/tshirt-back.jpg){: .center-block}
</div>
</div>

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

We've received a lot of requests from our team members to join the club and be _team-member-1_, but this T-shirt is exclusive for the real team-member-ones, who transparently and efficiently took care of GitLab.com during its worst hours.

## Wrapping Up

At GitLab, we value most positive achievements and performance improvements of our team members, instead of focusing our attention on negative random situations.

Of course, we take situations like this very seriously, but we'd rather learn from them, and put all our efforts to avoid that they happen again, than punishing honest and talented people for mistakes that can happen to anyone.
