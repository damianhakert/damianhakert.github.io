## GitLab Hierarchical Groups
{: .ce-ee}

We're really excited about this new feature in 9.0 that unlocks new ways to structure and organize your GitLab groups.

You are now able to create sub-groups inside a group. Imagine you have internal teams, or want to structure your GitLab projects in a more folder-like way - you can now create up to 20 levels of groups with sub-groups and create or move projects into that new structure. Take a look at the example screenshot below that shows a list of your groups, and you can see we've added categorisation using sub-groups for Design, Backend and Frontend.

![Nested Groups](/images/9_0/gitlab-nested.png){: .shadow}

Over the coming releases, we will continue to improve nested groups and would love to hear what new features and functionality you want to see. For some up-coming UI improvements, feel free to [browse or create](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=nested+groups) issues on GitLab with the `Nested Group` tag.

### Issue Boards Improvements

Issue Boards are a great way to manage issues moving through the different stages (which we call lists) of getting an idea to production code. But users often want to further represent order or priority of issues within a single list. With 9.0, you can now reorder issues within lists, using the intutitive and existing drag and drop mechanism. Learn more in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/issue_board.html).

![Boards Reorder](/images/9_0/boards_reorder.gif){: .shadow}

A GitLab issue board enables you manage a group of issues within a single milestone, but requires you to select the associated milestone filter each time you navigate to it. With GitLab 9.0 EES, you can now create an issue board that is associated to a specific milestone. This allows you to create unique boards for individual milestones. As you plan and execute work in each new milestone, we suggest you keep creating new boards. This allows you to conveniently work in multiple boards if you are straddling between milestones, and it also allows you to save and look back at previous completed milestones too.

### API V4

Our [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/) is a great way to automate tasks, control and automate GitLab in new and powerful ways. Over time, we have continued to improve our API to make it more complete and support the new features we add every month to make GitLab the best end-to-end development environment.

This constant iteration has resulted in a few inconsistencies in our existing API. Today we are announcing V4 of our API, which aims to make the API more consistent and more RESTful. [Take a look](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/v3_to_v4.html) at the changes in V4 to see what's different.

We will continue to support v3 of the API until August 2017 and so we encourage you to make any necessary changes to applications that use the V3 API.

### GitLab CI

To follow conventions of naming across GitLab, and to further move away from the
`build` term and toward `job`, CI variables [have been renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/9756) for the 9.0
release.

| 8.X name | 9.0 name |
|----------|----------|
| `CI_BUILD_ID` | `CI_JOB_ID` |
| `CI_BUILD_REF` | `CI_COMMIT_SHA` |
| `CI_BUILD_TAG` | `CI_COMMIT_TAG` |
| `CI_BUILD_REF_NAME` | `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` |
| `CI_BUILD_REF_SLUG` | `CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG` |
| `CI_BUILD_NAME` | `CI_JOB_NAME` |
| `CI_BUILD_STAGE` | `CI_JOB_STAGE` |
| `CI_BUILD_REPO` | `CI_REPOSITORY` |
| `CI_BUILD_TRIGGERED` | `CI_PIPELINE_TRIGGERED` |
| `CI_BUILD_MANUAL` | `CI_JOB_MANUAL` |
| `CI_BUILD_TOKEN` | `CI_JOB_TOKEN` |

The old variables will still work, but will be deprecated soon.

### Impersonation Tokens

Alongside the new API, we've also added [Impersonation tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/25367). If you've ever built a bot or a piece of functionality with our API, you'll often have to retrieve a token via oAuth. This can sometimes be undesirable and cumbersome to have to go through a UI flow in order to retrieve this token. Administrators of a GitLab instance can now retrieve an impersonation token on behalf of a user to make this process a lot easier and centrally controlled. This process will also alleviate any issues caused by users inadvertently invalidating tokens in use for other applications.

### New Branch for Bare Projects

When you click the `New branch` button in an issue, you probably want to start code development.
Currently for a project with an empty **Repository**, when this happens, GitLab stubbornly sends you back to the **Project** view.
With 9.0, when you click the `New branch` in this case, GitLab automatically creates the master branch, commits a blank `README.md` file to it, and creates and redirects you to a new branch based on the issue title.
If your [project is already configured with a deployment service][project-services-doc] (e.g. Kubernetes), GitLab takes one step further and prompts you to set up [auto deploy][auto-deploy-doc] by helping you create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

[project-services-doc]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/integrations/project_services.html
[auto-deploy-doc]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/autodeploy/index.html

### More control over HTTP Strict Transport Security settings

Now you fine tune your Strict Transport Security enforcement just by changing settings in your Omnibus GitLab config.
[Learn more][hsts-settings-doc] how you can use HTTP Strict Transport Security to provide your installation with even better protection against MITM attacks.

[hsts-settings-doc]: https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/nginx.html#setting-http-strict-transport-security

### Performance Improvements

As with every release, we've worked hard to make GitLab faster. With 9.0 in particular, we've put a particular focus on noticeable performance improvements across the board. Most notably searching with ElasticSearch as well as dealing with issue labels.

[Take a look](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name%5B%5D=performance&milestone_title=9.0&scope=all&state=closed) at the full list of performance improvements in 9.0 and keep an eye out for further improvements in up-coming releases as GitLab continues to get faster, especially for large installations.

Did you know, [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) is "merely" a massive-scale implementation of GitLab EE with hundreds of thousands of users? This just shows the level of scale that you can run GitLab EE and these performance improvements should start making a noticeable difference to the speed and reliability of GitLab.com.

### Omnibus GitLab Package Improvements

#### Raspberry Pi 2 changes

Due to a fault in release process that was caused by changes in build infrastructure,
packages for Raspberry Pi 2 [were tagged under Debian distribution instead of Raspbian](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1303).

We've resolved this issue and also synced all latest versions of packages
to `Raspbian` distribution.

Going forward, we will only release Raspberry Pi 2 packages under `Raspbian` distribution.
Further more, as [announced in 8.17 release post](/2017/02/22/gitlab-8-17-released/#raspbian-wheezy-package),
we will provide only Jessie packages for Rasperry Pi 2.

If you did any manual changes to the apt repository as a workaround, you will need to change the distribution.
You can do this by running:

`sed -i 's/debian/raspbian/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab_raspberry-pi2.list`

### Upgrade barometer

*** DESCRIBE HOW INVOLVED THE MIGRATIONS ARE. CAN USERS EXPECT MUCH DOWNTIME? ***
*** CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY MIGRATIONS THAT REMOVE OR CHANGE COLUMNS. ***
*** IF THERE ARE ONLY ADDITIONS OR NO MIGRATIONS CONFIRM THAT DEPLOY CAN BE WITHOUT DOWNTIME ****

#### Note

We assume you are upgrading from the latest version. If not, then also consult the upgrade barometers of any intermediate versions you are skipping.
If you are upgrading from a GitLab version prior to 8.0 *and* you have CI enabled, you have to upgrade to GitLab 8.0 [first](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/22/gitlab-8-0-released/).

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

<!-- Instructions (delete them when accomplished) -->

<section style="display: none;">

## Instructions

This is how the post will look like: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/images/new-release-post-example.jpg

1. Read through https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/#quick-guide-for-release-posts
2. Include in the same MR an update to data/promo.yml:

```yaml
text: "GitLab X.X Released with MAIN_CE_FEATURE and MAIN_EE_FEATURE"
link: '/AAAA/MM/DD/gitlab-x-x-released/'
```

3. Embedding Videos

To embed videos, use the figure tag with the video_container class. It will guarantee
that the video is responsive. Replace only the video URL:

<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>

Video caption
{: .figcaption}

Caption is optional.

Ref: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#videos

4. Screenshots: try to keep the screenshots with the same width for a nicer layout. Add shadow to them whenever they have a white background that can be confused with the post background:

![IMAGE ALT TEXT](IMAGE_URL){: .shadow}

5. Features:
  - First feature is always middle placed, after that you can alternate between features with image on the right or left and again a centered feature.
  - When you place an image in the left section it needs to be reversed on smaller viewports. The class "small-reverse" does that.
  - Apply the classes `{: .ce-ee}` (CE features), `{: .ees}` (EE Starter features), or `{: .eep}` (EE Premium features) to features' headings accordingly.

6. Aligning content to the top:

Whenever you need to align content to the top of each column, apply
the class `vertical-align-top` to both `left` and `right` sections:

<!-- left aligned section block -->
<section class="left vertical-align-top">

Enter description

</section>
<!-- end of left aligned section block -->
<!-- right aligned section block -->
<section class="right vertical-align-top">

Enter description

</section>
<!-- end of right aligned section block -->
<!-- end of instructions  -->

7. Release webcasts

Once the release webcast is published on YouTube, if you want to include the recording
into the blog post, replace the section "blog post intro" with the following block.

Don't forget to replace the Lorem Ipsum text with the actual intro. For the video tag,
replace **only** the video URL.

<!-- intro section (with video) -->
<section class="left vertical-align-top">

Intro (visible on blog landing page) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
Inventore incidunt consequatur blanditiis iusto laborum repudiandae,
eligendi in impedit temporibus numquam reiciendis dolor culpa repellendus.

<!-- more -->

Nisi obcaecati numquam incidunt impedit necessitatibus ipsam qui illum,
praesentium a esse. Cum porro ut id impedit expedita nostrum aut quibusdam,
accusamus laboriosam maiores nesciunt voluptas deleniti harum doloribus
tempore quasi fuga accusantium in odit facilis.
