As stated in the [GitLab Master Plan][gitlab-master-plan], we strive to maintain
a high level of [transparency](/handbook/values/). That's why today we are making our release retrospective and kickoff notes and
calls public.

## The Retrospective Meeting

After each release we have a retrospective
call in which we discuss what went well, what went wrong, and what we can improve
for the next release. The [retrospective notes] are public and you are invited
to comment on them. If you're interested, you can even join the
[retrospective call][retro-kickoff-call], on the first working day after the 22nd
at 6pm CET / 9am PST.

## The Kickoff Meeting

Before working on the next release we have a
kickoff call to explain what we expect to ship in the next release. The
[kickoff notes] are public and you are invited to comment on them.
If you're interested, you can even join the [kickoff call][retro-kickoff-call],
on the first working day after the 7th at 6pm CET / 9am PST.

## The 8.16 Retrospective and 8.17 Kickoff call

The next retrospective and kickoff call recordings will be available on the

We look forward to reading all your comments on these documents and to
seeing your face in the calls!
