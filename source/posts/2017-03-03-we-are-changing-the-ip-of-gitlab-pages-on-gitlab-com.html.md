## What is changing?

We are changing the [IP address of **GitLab Pages** server on **GitLab.com**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues/883) to `52.167.214.135`.

## Which websites will be affected?

Only websites hosted with GitLab Pages **on GitLab.com** set up with a **custom root domain**, such as `example.com`, which has a DNS `A` record pointing to `104.208.235.32`, will be affected.

## Which GitLab Pages websites will NOT be affected?

No other websites hosted with GitLab Pages will be affected, more specifically:

- On-premise GitLab will not be affected.
- GitLab Hosted (GitHost) will not be affected. 
- GitLab.com websites with default Pages domains (`*.gitlab.io`) will not be affected.
- GitLab.com websites with custom subdomains, like `subdomain.example.com`, set up with DNS `CNAME` records will not be affected.

## What do I have to do?

If you have a [DNS `A` record](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_three.html#dns-a-record) pointing your domain to `104.208.235.32`, edit it to point to `52.167.214.135`. If you cannot edit it, delete it and create a new one.

## When will the old IP be deactivated?

**31 March 2017 at 23:59h UTC**.

### Can I change the DNS `A` record right now?

Yes, and we ask you to do so as soon as possible. Currently we have both IPs working but from 1 April 2017 only the new IP address will work.

### What happens if I don't do anything?

If you have a website hosted with GitLab Pages **on GitLab.com** set up with a **custom root domain** and don't update your DNS `A` record by the deadline, your website will be unaccesible from 1 April 2017.

## Why is this happening?

Due to recent GitLab.com infrastructure improvements a number of IP addresses, including the one used for GitLab Pages, had to change.
