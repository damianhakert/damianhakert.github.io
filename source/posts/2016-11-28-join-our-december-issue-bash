+
+ Join us for an all-weekend Issue Bash on 3-4 December and you could walk away with (PRIZE TBC).
+
+
+ There are currently over 5000 open issues on GitLab CE! We want everyone to be able to find issues to work on, and part of that means streamlining our issue tracker: culling duplicate issues, categorizing unlabelled issues and tackling bugs. 
+
+
+Our last Bug Bash helped us squash X bugs in X hours, let’s see what we can do this time!
+
+
+## When is it?
+
+
+It all kicks off at 00:01 UTC on Saturday, 3 December and will run until 23:59 UTC on Sunday, 4 December.
+
+
+## How can you get involved?
+
+
+Help us close issues: identify duplicate issues so a team member can close them
+
+
+Investigate bugs: attempt to reproduce labeled bugs in a test project on GitLab.com
+
+
+Fix bugs: close bug issues once and for all
+
+
+Categorize existing issues: provide a suitable label for uncategorized issues
+
+
+Check out the 2016 GitLab-ce Issue Bash Proposal to find out how to get started.
+
+
+## Who can take part?
+
+
+This is a chance for anyone in the GitLab community to get involved, even if you don’t have technical experience. Some of the tasks above, like categorizing issues or spotting duplicates, are ideal for non-technical community members. 
+
+
+## Questions? More info?
+
+
+GitLab team members @markgenfletcher @ClemMakesApps @haynes will be on hand to answer questions and close issues.
