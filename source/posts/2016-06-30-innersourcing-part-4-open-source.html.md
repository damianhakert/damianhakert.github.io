The last of our series on trends in version control land, this time we’re looking to the future. When it comes to software, what’s likely to happen next?

## Two Words: Open Source

It turns out that as more companies get comfortable with the implications around open source—letting go of control to the extent that collaboration is more productive—open source is turning out to be an incredibly good solution in a number of industries. In fact, according to this report, in 2016 78% of companies were using some form of open source software, and 65% were contributing to open source projects.

The industries where open source happens most quickly tend to be in those verticals which are closest to developers (for example development tooling). The reasons for this are many; first of all, developers have the skills and the motivation to “scratch our own itch,” ie. develop solutions that fit the problems we have, and open source is built for that. Also, adoption of open source is probably easier where personnel and decision-makers include those who already are likely to know about and understand the value of open source approaches and intersourcing [link to post on intersourcing].

At the same time, more and more enterprise infrastructure is becoming open source, including networking programs, security scanning, ERP etc.

## Who’s Not Going Open Source?

Things that are used by a lot of people are more likely to go open source, and things that are used by fewer people are less likely to do so. For example, the healthcare industry has extremely specialized software in many cases, with a lot of security issues involved, so open source is happening slower there and may not affect everyone. The same goes for the oil and gas industry, again where the software has a very specific client base and security is a major issue. For these kinds of industries it makes sense to retain proprietary software.

And that’s about it. For most other types of software, as long as you give people an avenue by which to contribute, they will contribute.

Interesting, yes? If you liked this post, you can go back and read our previous Trends posts on intersourcing, rapid deployment, and microservices. [provide links]
