Have you ever wondered how to keep a fork automatically up-to-date with its remote origin?

In this post we'll show you how to do that on GitLab!

## Fork

As you most likely know, a **fork** is a copy of a Git repository "connected" with the project you forked from (upstream). When you collaborate on code, it's pretty common forking a project, cloning to your local machine, making the changes you're up to, pushing to your fork, and submitting a merge request (MR) to merge your code into the original project.

You fork a repository whenever you want to contribute to a project which you don't have access to, as it's not your own or your team's. This is how open source projects hosted in GitLab get so much collaboration from the community.

When you are a member of a project (or a group), it's easier using the [GitLab Flow](/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/), or _branching strategy_, once anyone in your team can pull your branch and preview your changes locally. However, with our brand-new solution for this, called [Review Apps](/features/review-apps), you can preview your apps in a per-branch basis, for each MR submitted to GitLab, directly from a link generated by GitLab. Review Apps came to bring the [GitLab Workflow](/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/) up to the next level! ðŸ™Œ

## The Problem

When you fork a project and clone it to your local computer, you need to update it with the master branch of the upstream project to be able to checkout a new branch up-to-date. If you do not do that, perhaps your changes can break the app once you merge it to the upstream, since the copy of the code you're working on is out-of-date.

To prevent this, you need first update your local repo, then start your work. This takes time and if you forget to do it, can cause a lot of pain. What I'd normally do is the following:

- Open the project in the terminal and checkout `master`

    ```shell
    cd <directory>
    git checkout master
    ```

- Pull the upstream master branch
    
    ```shell
    git pull https://gitlab.com/<namespace>/<project>.git master
    ```

- Git will prompt you to commit
- Push to your fork
    
    ```shell
    git push origin master
    ```

- Checkout a new branch

    ```shell
    git checkout -b your-new-branch
    ```

- Make changes
- Add, commit and push to your fork

    ```shell
    git add
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push origin your-new-branch
    ```

- Create a new merge request in the GitLab UI to merge `your-fork/your-new-branch` into the `upstream/master`

**Note:** You can rebase it too, but particularly, I prefer pulling, as rebasing can get messy.

As you can see, this sequence takes some time to complete, and turns out to be annoying if you need to do this multiple times a day. That's why we need a better solution.

## The Solution

GitLab can do that for you with no pain! Yay!

What you need to do is very simple: enable [GitLab Repository Mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/repository_mirroring.html)!

**First**. Mirror your fork:

Under your forked project's **Settings**, navigate to **Mirror Repository**:

![settings - mirror repository](/images/blogimages/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-its-origin/mirror-repository-settings.png){:.shadow}

**Second**. Add the upstream's path to the field **Git repository URL**, then enable automatic mirroring:

![fork - enable automatic repository update](/images/blogimages/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-its-origin/setup-automatic-mirror.png){:.shadow}

**Third**. Setup the **mirror user**: it's the user whose the new commits to the upstream project will be attributed to in your fork.

Done! Once an hour, GitLab will pull the upstream for you, and keep your fork up-to-date!

By doing so, you only need to take care of your branching strategy before starting to work. All the rest GitLab does for you!

- Open the project in the terminal and checkout `master`
    
    ```shell
    cd <directory>
    git checkout master
    ```

- Update your local branch with the origin
    
    ```shell
    git pull
    ```

- Checkout a new branch

    ```shell
    git checkout -b your-new-branch
    ```

- Make changes
- Add, commit and push to your fork

    ```
    git add
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push origin your-new-branch
    ```

- Create a new merge request in the GitLab UI to merge `your-fork/your-new-branch` into the `upstream/master`

Simple, isn't it? 

Repository mirroring is available for free at **GitLab.com** and for all **GitLab Enterprise Edition** users.
