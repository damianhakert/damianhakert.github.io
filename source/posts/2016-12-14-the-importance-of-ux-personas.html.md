description: “What are UX personas and why should you use them in product development?”
---
When developing a product, it’s easy to assume that users are just like ourselves. If we use our assumptions to not only lead what we develop, but how we develop something, there is a much greater risk of creating a product that does not address users’ needs.

Personas provide a team with a shared understanding of users. Personas are fictional characters created to represent the major needs and expectations of the different types of users that use a website, product or service. A persona typically has a name, a picture, background and demographic information such as age, highest level of education and work experience. It provides a clear understanding of why and how a person is using your product and documents any pain points they experience, both in the context of using the product and the environment in which the product is used. Finally, it summarizes their goals; what do they hope to solve or achieve by using your product? This information is normally collected using both qualitative (surveys, user interviews, etc) and quantitative research techniques (web analytics). Therefore, whilst a persona itself is fictional, it is formed using factual data to provide a realistic model of user needs.

A good persona generates empathy for users by putting a “human face” on data. Its aim is to summarize and share research findings with anybody contributing towards the success of the product. It’s easier for an individual regardless of their job title, to understand a persona which collectively represents the motivations, frustrations and goals of thousands of users, than it is to trawl through days, or even months' worth, of research findings. A product manager may use personas to validate and prioritize features whereas a designer may use them to determine the overall visual style of a product.

When everybody within a team has a shared understanding of users, disagreements surrounding product development are reduced as there is a greater consensus about what is right for users. By defining personas, there is a well-documented, clear focus on who the product is for, which stops users’ needs from being altered to suit an idea or concept.

When we truly understand a user’s mindset when interacting with our product, we start to relate to their experiences and subsequently can begin to predict their behavior. Imagine the last time you were engrossed in a television series, it’s likely that you connected with one or more of the leading characters, because you could understand and on some level, relate to, their emotions, responses and actions in a given situation. You probably discussed the television series with a friend and together, you may have guessed at future plot lines based on the events which had occurred so far in the series. Personas work in a similar way; they create an imaginary story about an individual which can be shared and easily recollected. They promote further discussions within a team about how a user would interact with a proposed idea. By internalizing the user, we adopt their mentality and form solutions based on what’s best for the user and their given situation.

At GitLab, we are in the early stages of discovering who our personas are. If you want to make sure that as a user your needs and expectations are met, then you can help us by [completing our survey][survey link] and sharing your views.

The qualitative data from this survey will be analyzed and categorized by coding similar responses. A code is a word or short phrase that describes a respondent’s answer. Codes condense the information collected into key themes and topics. Whilst statistical analysis will be used to summarize and describe the quantitative data (close-ended questions) in the survey. We can then interpret these findings to form a basis for our personas. 

When drawing conclusions from the survey data, it’s important to recognize the limitations of what the data is telling us, therefore we will triangulate any findings with the outcome of user interviews and web analytics. By comparing multiple research methods, we can consider whether findings are similar and ensure that the personas are based on supporting evidence.
