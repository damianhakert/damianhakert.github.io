We were so glad to hear that [CodePen] switched from GitHub to GitLab!

<!-- more -->

Particularly, I'm a big fan of CodePen. Their product is awesome: it's
intuitive, beautiful, works like a charm, and it's really easy to use.
Their community's work is involving - we can pass hours trying pens like these:

When I heard that they had switched to GitLab, it was a blast! Yaaay! **Welcome Codepen!** <i class="fa fa-codepen" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-gitlab" aria-hidden="true"></i>

They're very cool folks, only [eight of them][team]
make such an awesome product! They're also remote-only, like us.

Listen to their podcast episode, which details why and how this move went. If you'd rather read,
we've gathered some highlights in the following section.

## Highlights

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
### <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Control
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
The first thing they talked about is "control". They can't rely in a third-party service to deploy
their code. Whenever there's a downtime, there's nothing they can do about it. With GitLab, self-hosted,
they have the ability to exercise control over their server, and everything else.
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
### <i class="fa fa-lock fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Security
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Because it's self-hosted, they feel much more protected from hacker attacks, and system breaches.
They have their own private network space, in which they run GitLab.
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
### <i class="fa fa-code fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Open Source
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
They support open source projects and are happy with our free and opens source product, GitLab CE.
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
### <i class="fa fa-refresh fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
They finally don't need to rely on third-party services to apply Continuous Integration to test and
deploy their code. GitLab CI does this job, and it's built-in GitLab.

They also enjoy not having to deploy from the command line, as it was impossible to track. They
love our Pipelines, where the entire team can see what's going on and who's doing what. The steps are visible.
Yes guys and girls, we love transparency too!

> _I feel more comfortable with GitLab_

They also love the rollback button: no pain, all gain. Now it's easy to roll back if something goes wrong.
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
### <i class="fa fa-heart-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Their impression
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Overall, GitLab brought to them speed, security, and agility.
</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
### <i class="fa fa-chain fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Everything in one place
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
They appreciate having the Issue Boards, Todos, and Time Tracking in one single
platform, tied together with their code.

They called it "grown up project management"! :D

They mentioned how cool is, from the Issue Tracker commenting system, perform a slash command
to add how long it's gonna take to complete the implementation of a feature.

It is important for project planning and management to have everything integrated.

</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-orange">
### <i class="fa fa-heartbeat fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> The transition
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
With GitLab Importer, it's just import your projects from GitHub directly from the UI, which means
pushing a button.

> _Choose the repos you want, and click "import", "import", "import"..._

</div>
</div>

<div class="panel panel-gitlab-purple">
### <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Takeaway
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
They don't need GitHub, Trello, and Codeship to go from idea to production anymore; they have GitLab
<i class="fa fa-heart gitlab-orange" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</div>
</div>
