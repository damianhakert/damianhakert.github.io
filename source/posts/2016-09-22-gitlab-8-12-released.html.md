## Upgrade barometer


*** DESCRIBE HOW INVOLVED THE MIGRATIONS ARE. CAN USERS EXPECT MUCH DOWNTIME? ***
*** CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY MIGRATIONS THAT REMOVE OR CHANGE COLUMNS. ***
*** IF THERE ARE ONLY ADDITIONS OR NO MIGRATIONS CONFIRM THAT DEPLOY CAN BE WITHOUT DOWNTIME ****


*Note* We assume you are upgrading from the latest version. If not, then also consult the upgrade barometers of any intermediate versions you are skipping.
If you are upgrading from a GitLab version prior to 8.0 *and* you have CI enabled, you have to upgrade to GitLab 8.0 [first](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/22/gitlab-8-0-released/).

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`
file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
