A common misconception is that developer marketing is showing up at
events and giving out free t-shirts and stickers. While true,
developers are humans and people like free t-shirts, it is not
and cannot be the only method to your developer marketing
strategy, it's a whole lot more.

## Marketing a Developer Product

**How do we market to developers?** This is a question I've seen asked
multiple times at multiple organizations. Every company that's building
tools for developers has at some point struggled on how to properly
market to their target audience. I've seen it at large organizations,
I've seen it at small organizations, and we've all seen product
messaging that doesn't quite fit what the product actually does.

Often,
this is due to a disconnect between marketing and engineering/product
and/or the marketing team not understanding **how to message a developer
product**. While people are quick to assume negative intentions of the
marketing team, generally that isn't the case. It comes down to messaging
and communication between marketing and your engineering/product team.
Developers are awesome. Go talk to them.

## How to Market to Developers

**Is it hard to market to developers?** No, however, there's a big focus on
truth in marketing, getting a developer help fast when they need it,
developer education, community, and making sure that your marketing
doesn't over-promise what the product is capable of doing.

The team has to balance how you market a developer product with the
expectations of the developer using that product. For example, most
users of an developer tool will not expect an email from a demand
generation team or BDR team and they certainly will not expect a phone call.

### Meeting Expectations

**So what do developers expect?** They will expect education, help getting
started, tutorials, partner integrations that make their lives easier,
and **truth in marketing**. Developers want the truth, they want
proper education, they want integrations that help them, and they want
the marketing team to kind of stay out of the way while quietly
sprinkling helpful information around the areas that they are interested in.

### Sources of Information

Some forums that developers use to get information are
[StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com),
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/),
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/), Twitter, GitLab Documentation,
GitHub, a basic Google search, and all of these channels should be
taken into account when thinking about how to market a developer product.
Where possible, try to offer community support via these forums. Be responsive.

## Marketing Strategy

### Event Strategy

For an event strategy, you need to not only think "how do I bring people
together in a room that are using my product" but also "how do I get
feedback from that room" or "how do I make sure that conversations are
happening between GitLab team members and GitLab community members?".

Use your event presence to talk to people that love your product. Give
engaging talks and make it easy to give feedback. "How do I make it clear that
feedback is appreciated?". You do that through saying, "Hey, I'd like feedback
on this". Sometimes you don't even have to say it and because the developer
community is such an open and honest one in most cases, feedback is easier
to get.

Make it easy to provide feedback, make it easy to become part of the
community, make it easy to contribute and people and developers will.
Developer roundtables are awesome. You need a room, some developers using
your product and someone to take notes.

### Content Strategy

For a content strategy, much of the same applies. Education, tutorials,
and making it really easy to get started through blog posts, video,
screencasts, office hours, webinars, etc.

## The Product

In addition to the above mentioned tactics, good developer marketing
strategy includes a great product. If you have a **great product**, the
job of marketing is much easier. Constant product and feature releases
are one of the best marketing tools. We are lucky that GitLab releases
on the twenty-second of every month and has since 2011. This show of
momentum makes it much easier to market a developer when it's not stagnant.

In product releases, when your users can see that feedback from the
community is taken seriously and put back into the product, it says
"we take our community seriously". Listen to the feedback, make it
easy to give feedback via issue trackers, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab),
and/or [Support](/getting-help/) and
if it makes sense for the rest of the community to make a requested
update to the product, do it.

### Product Launch

For every new feature or new product, we need to coordinate the entire team
in order to have a successful launch. It's crucial having an efficient
communication between every team involved: developers, product, executives, and marketing.
We use [Conversational Development](/2016/09/13/gitlab-master-plan/#convdev) to achieve
the results we need. Our communication happens mostly within GitLab.com, with issues and
merge requests not only for the product itself, but for posts, webpages, media assets, documentation,
and a lot more. We track the whole process cohesively and consistently across our own platform.

Recently, we launched the [GitLab Issue Board](/2016/08/22/announcing-the-gitlab-issue-board/),
[Cycle Analytics](/2016/09/21/cycle-analytics-feature-highlight/), and we revealed the
[GitLab Master Plan](/2016/09/13/gitlab-master-plan/). We were thrilled by the involvement
of our community, with tons of tweets, messages, emails, comments on posts, the explosive 
chat on YouTube, and the questions and comments posted on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12487112). We raised the roof! All this
success was the result of teamwork and much effort to not only have everything in place,
on time, but also, to make sure the information spread was accurate and available throughout
all the different channels we use to market.
