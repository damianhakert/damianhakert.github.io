---

There are currently over 6000 open issues on GitLab CE,
and we need your help to sort them out! We have over 1500
[GitLab contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/contributors/), and we want everyone to be able to
find issues to work on.

Of course, the best contributors will be prized with XXXX,
and we'll promise to give some awesome swag away! ðŸ™Œ

<!-- more -->

Our last Issue Bash helped us to close over 100 issues and lots of improvements to the categorization of existing issues were made.

This is your chance to get involved! Most of the tasks don't require
technical expertize, therefore, non-technical community
members are definitely welcome and prize-worthy!

## How to Get Involved?

There are mainly four things we need from our task force:

- Track issues that can be easily closed
- Categorize issues
- Fix known bugs and pain points
- Shipping existing feature proposals

Check out the [Issue Bash Proposal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/27272) to find out how to get started.

To be considered for a prize you need at least one contribution
accepted by the time GitLab x.xx releases on XXXX 22nd.
Prizes will be drawn at random.

GitLab team members [@markglenfletcher](https://gitlab.com/markglenfletcher), [@ClemMakesApps](https://gitlab.com/ClemMakesApps), and [@haynes](https://gitlab.com/haynes) will be on hand to answer questions and close issues.
