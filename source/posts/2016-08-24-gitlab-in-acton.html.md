A huge part of the company culture at GitLab is the fact that we are fully remote. We have no hub; google hangouts are at our core and we are thriving on this model.

Working remote affords so many opportunities that being tied to an office never could. For one, you get back the time you used to spend commuting. Some use this extra time to sleep, be with their families, work out, practice their craft, or just relax.  We still have routines and daily schedules they just happen with pajama pants on üòÉ

Two of my coworkers, whom I think are really excelling at this remote work thing, are Robert and Douwe. They won‚Äôt promote their awesomeness so I have to. They have set out to meet other Gitlabbers in 12 different countries for the next 6 months. They are calling it, ‚ÄúAround the World in 6 Releases‚Äù.

Every week or two they head to a new city, spend the week days working, the evenings with the local team members, and the weekends sightseeing. I had the pleasure of meeting up with them on a leg of their North America tour.

## Nashville:

Something to note about them- they would rather work than go to the country music hall of fame with me. They would also rather make me eat all the fried bologna sandwiches and moon pies than participate.

Nashville is such a welcoming lively city. We honkey tonked, Douwe had his first tater tot, and worked from a bowling alley that also had a swimming pool and served some damn good coffee. John made sure we celebrated National Mac and Cheese Day right with some Hot Hattie B‚Äôs mac topped with their famous hot chicken. When they couldn‚Äôt take any more of me leaving Dolly Parton on repeat they put on Kimmy Schmit and pretend to go to sleep.

## Denver:
Our local hosts Phil and Josh were determined to show us the best Denver had to offer. They tried to take us to Rockies game, which unfortunately got rained. We made the best of it by going got a local developer meetup. Phil and Josh welcomed us to their local WeWork and once we needed a change of scenery we moved to the bar downstairs where we were shockingly productive considering we were working from a brewery.

## Salt Lake City:
I had to go home to get clean clothes, but they reported Utah was filled with natural beauty. Their highlight was getting to meet and go to dinner with a local GitLab contributor.

## Las Vegas:
I can confidently say the highlight for everyone in Vegas was the Queer Con Pool Party. We were so overcome with excitement at being there we jumped in the pool fully clothed and swam listening to the DJ for hours. John, in an effort to make us all look like slobs, rented a tux for the event. It took a bit of coaxing, but he eventually caved an did the most epic cannonball into the pool in a full out monkey suit. John claims his #tuxedoswim trending on Twitter was worth the extra dry cleaning bill.

From Vegas they headed to South America where their remote work adventure continues. Look out for their future blog series on the coffee shops with the best wifi in the world and other insights from these road warriors.
