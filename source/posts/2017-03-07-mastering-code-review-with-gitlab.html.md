How exactly you want to conduct your code review is up to your team-how you share knowledge and best practices between contributors, how you solve problems and divide your workload, and even how you bond might vary significantly from how our teams do so. 

But whatever your team’s rhythm, we expect you face similar pressure to ship new features. Our code review tools were built with the aim of enhancing your review process, taking you from idea to production while setting new personal records for code delivery and quality.

## Demo

In this video, Discussion Lead Sean McGivern walks through our typical process.

## Typical Flow

Excellent code depends on rigorous review. At GitLab, every change is reviewed using this flow:

* A developer makes a change in their feature branch and tests it. When they’re happy they push, and make a merge request.
* The developer assigns the merge request to a reviewer, who looks at it and makes line and design level comments as appropriate. When the reviewer is finished, they assign it back to the author. 
* The author addresses the comments. This stage can go around for a while, but once both are happy, one assigns to a final reviewer who can merge.
* The final reviewer follows the same process again. The author again addresses any comments, either by changing the code or by responding with their own comments.
* Once the final reviewer is happy and the build is green, they will merge.
