description: 'How we move so quickly and create so much at GitLab'
---

About 2 months ago I joined GitLab and in that time I have seen 2 new releases,
had the quickest and smoothest team onboarding I have ever had,
pushed dozens of changes and
have gotten to know almost everyone in GitLab.
So how do we move so quickly and create so much at GitLab?

## The GitLab Handbook and Communication

At GitLab we are a [remote only](remote-only) company which means
we have to diligently record and document knowledge to be efficient.
The result is if you ask a GitLab team member an organizational question
the answer is always "Its in the handbook".
Our [handbook](handbook) is public, copy it, adapt it and make it your own.

## Everyone deserves one manager

todo

Points:

- do one thing, no big plans
- if it is better than what is there merge
discuss afterwards
- conversational development
- gitlab flow
- idea to production
- cycle analytics 1 and 2

Quotes:

vision

> The vision of GitLab is to allow everyone to collaborate on all digital content so people can cooperate effectively and achieve better results, faster. We can do this by providing an integrated set of tools that allows you to go faster from idea to production.

convdev

> Conversational Development (ConvDev) is a natural evolution of software development that carries a conversation across functional groups throughout the development process, enabling developers to track the full path of development in a cohesive and intuitive way. ConvDev accelerates the development lifecycle by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing from idea to production.

> I think that Gitlab already took a part of the market from Github and that this progression is going to continue thanks to the incredible rate at which the product is developped. The existing features and the ones that are coming are going to make Gitlab an even more central tool than it is today. It is probable that, in a few months, we will not need anything more than Gitlab to manage the whole lifecycle of a project.
