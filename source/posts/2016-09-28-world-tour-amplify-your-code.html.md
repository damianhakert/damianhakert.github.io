Luckily, GitLab is here to pitch you an idea you to help get your act together.
We kicking of the GitLab World Tour to help harmonize your development process because code is our forte.

## Are you ready to amplify your code?

The World Tour will makes stops in **London**, **New York**, and **Amsterdam** before ending on a high note
in **San Francisco** at our user conference early next year. The GitLab Team will travel city to city,
working in concert with git users like yourself, gathering feedback and stories to help make your git
workflow even more seamless. We would also like to trumpet about some major developments features in GitLab.

Here is a list of some of the topics we will be covering:

1. Modern Software Development
