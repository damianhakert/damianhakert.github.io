Even the sharpest teams face minor set backs when their code falls flat, or their team is just not in tune. 
O-boe-y, nobody wants that.

Software development is changing and with it, the way developers work. Todayâ€™s rapid pace of 
communication and innovation fosters creativity, collaboration, and information sharing; 
bringing ideas to lifeâ€”faster. Luckily, GitLab is here to pitch you an idea you to help you boost your act.

We spend our days listening to our community and thinking about how we can
build the best tool to help modern developers move faster from idea to production. 
So we're kicking of the GitLab World Tour to help harmonize your development process because code is our forte. 
Join us as we explore how teams are using Git and other modern development practices to work together and build amazing products. 

## What to Expect ##

### Inspiration ###
It's an exciting time to be a developer. There is a steady rise of new tools, languages, and practices. 
We'll take a look at some incredible projects and share information that you can take back to your teams. 

### Conversation ###
We value our community and are eager to trade ideas with you. We've planned our sessions to be interactive so there will be
plenty of time for you to ask questions about share feedback. 

### Swag ###
It's not a tour without some commemorative item that says, "I was here." Every stop on this tour will have their won city-specific GitLab swag.

<div class="panel-body">

**Conversational Development**
{: .panel-heading #convdev}
<div class="panel-body">
**Conversational Development (ConvDev)** is a natural evolution of software
development that carries a conversation across functional groups throughout
the development process, enabling developers to track the full path of
development in a cohesive and intuitive way. ConvDev accelerates the
development lifecycle by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing
from idea to production.

## Are you ready to amplify your code?

The World Tour will makes stops in **London**, **New York City**, and **Amsterdam** before ending on a high note
in **San Francisco** at our user conference early next year. The GitLab Team will travel city to city,
working in concert with git users like yourself, gathering feedback and stories to help make your git
workflow even more seamless. We would also like to trumpet about some major developments features in GitLab.

Here is a list of some of the topics we will be covering:

1. Modern Software Development
