There are times when pretty sharp teams get into treble <!-- "trouble", I guess? --> and face minor set backs
when their code falls flat or their team is just not in tune. O-boe-y, nobody wants that.
Luckily, GitLab is here to pitch you an idea you to help get your act together.
We kicking of the GitLab World Tour to help harmonize your development process because code is our forte.

{: .panel-heading #convdev}
<div class="panel-body">
**Conversational Development (ConvDev)** is a natural evolution of software
development that carries a conversation across functional groups throughout
the development process, enabling developers to track the full path of
development in a cohesive and intuitive way. ConvDev accelerates the
development lifecycle by fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing
from idea to production.

## Are you ready to amplify your code?

The World Tour will makes stops in **London**, **New York**, and **Amsterdam** before ending on a high note
in **San Francisco** at our user conference early next year. The GitLab Team will travel city to city,
