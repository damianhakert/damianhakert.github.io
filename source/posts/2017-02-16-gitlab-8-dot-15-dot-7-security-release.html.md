Today we are releasing versions 8.15.7 and 8.14.10 for GitLab 
Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). 

These versions contain an important security fix for Omnibus GitLab installations 
with Mattermost. We recommend that all GitLab installations running Omnibus 
versions 8.15 or 8.14 with Mattermost enabled be upgraded as soon as possible.

This release does not affect GitLab versions 8.16.0 and above.

Please read on for more details.

## Mattermost Security Update
Mattermost has not yet released full details, however a high severity security
release was published and Mattermost has advised all users to upgrade immediately.
A patch for Mattermost 3.6, shipped with Omnibus versions of GitLab 8.16, was 
released with GitLab 8.16.5 on February 14, 2017. A matching patch for Mattermost 
3.5, shipped with GitLab Omnibus versions 8.15 and 8.14, has now been made available. 
See the Mattermost [release notes] for more information.

### Versions affected

GitLab CE+EE Omnibus w/Mattermost 8.14.0 - 8.14.9, 8.15.0 - 8.15.6

We recommend that all installations listed above with Mattermost enabled be 
upgraded as soon as possible. No workarounds are available for these 
vulnerabilities.

GitLab users who do not have Mattermost enabled are not affected.

## Upgrade barometer

This version has no new migrations and should not require any downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations, 
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior 
can be changed by adding a `/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations` file.
