Developers are opinionated and rigorous when it comes to selecting tools, and they’re increasingly driving decisions in organizations that depend on them to beat their competition to market. 

Last year, we launched our [Global Developer Survey](https://page.gitlab.com/2016-developer-survey_2016-developer-survey.html) to explore how software development is adapting from pressures within and without, and how these changes affect the way teams work. In the survey’s first iteration, GitLab surveyed 362 startup and enterprise CTOs, developers and DevOps professionals globally who use our platform. In this post, I’ll share a few key findings, but you can get the full insights by downloading the [report](https://page.gitlab.com/2016-developer-survey_2016-developer-survey.html).

## Our Respondents are In-the-Know

Our sample is developer-heavy, with 53 percent of respondents identifying themselves as an engineer or developer, ensuring that their views are well-represented here.

## Devs Drive Adoption

Respondents to our survey told us emphatically that developers reign supreme when it comes to choosing tools. When asked who in their organization decides which tools they use, a plurality of 44 percent said they choose their own. 

The next most common response reinforces developers’ primacy in this area; 17 percent of respondents reported that their lead developer drives tool selection. It’s remarkable, and a clear sign of developers’ rising agency and power within their organizations, that less than 20 percent said that decision is made by their CTO/CIO, IT Director, or Head of Engineering. Tellingly, 11 percent insisted that they use whichever tools they want, even though they’re not officially in charge of the decision.

## They Insist on the Newest & Best

Developers’ increasing power to choose tooling is matched by the strength of their opinions. Eighty-one percent of respondents told us it’s critical for organizations to use the latest development tools. This insistence on using only the newest and best runs deep, even, in some cases, if it seems counter to their immediate self-interest: 36 percent of developers said they would reject a job if the organization did not use the latest tools. Once they’re satisfied with a tool, they also opt for consistency, with 91 percent of respondents telling us they’d prefer to use the same tools for work and personal projects.
