This was an exciting release for GitLab! We appreciate all of the commments from the community
on GitLab 8.11 being an "epic release." We couldn’t agree more. In addition to the release news, 
we made a point to highlight our vision more prominently. If you’re familiar with GitLab and 
our open culture, you know that our vision has always been listed on [our direction page][gitlab-vision]. However, in this 
release, we made our vision a part of our release story as well. GitLab is an integrated set of tools for 
the software development lifecycle. The launch of the GitLab Issue Board makes it easier for customers to 
plan, organize and visualize their issues. The GitLab Issue Board and the Issue Tracker are a perfectly 
paired project management solution. In this webcast, we walk through our vision, demo a couple great 
features of GitLab 8.11, and share what's next on our product roadmap.

## Key Takeaways

In case you don't have time to watch the full video, here are the highlights. 

* GitLab is an integrated set of tools, including repository management, access controls, code review, issue tracker, **Issue Board**, and wiki. GitLab supports the full software development lifecycle through its built-in Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Container Registry. 
* Our goal is to help teams go faster from idea to production. To do that, we've built chat, issues, wikis, code review, CI, and CD into a single UI. 
* We will ship this complete lifecycle in 2016.
 1. Idea → Mattermost ships with GitLab
 2. Issue → GitLab Issues 
 3. Plan → GitLab Issue Board
 4. Code → GitLab + Koding (IDE)
 5. Commit → GitLab Repositories 
 6. Test → GitLab CI, CD and Container Registry
 7. Review → GitLab Merge Requests
 8. Continuous Delivery → GitLab Deploy 
 9. Chatops → Chat Bots / Cog
 10. Feedback → Cycle Analytics
* GitLab Issue Board and Resolving Merge Conflicts in the UI are awesome features and you should really check them out.
