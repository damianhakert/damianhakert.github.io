As stated in the [GitLab Master Plan][gitlab-master-plan], we strive to maintain
a high level of [transparency]((https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/)). That's why today we are making our release retrospective and kickoff notes and
calls public.

## The Retrospective Meeting

After each release we have a retrospective
call  (usually on the 23rd of each month) in which we discuss what went well, what went wrong, and what we can improve
for the next release. The [retrospective notes] are public and you are invited
to comment on them. If you're interested, you can even join the
[retrospective call][retro-kickoff-call], on the 8th of every month at 6pm CET / 9am PST (unless it's on a weekend, then it's the first working day of the week after).

## The Kickoff Meeting

Before working on the next release (usually on the 8th of each month), we have a
kickoff call to explain what we expect to ship in the next release. The
[kickoff notes] are public and you are invited to comment on them.
If you're interested, you can even join the [kickoff call][retro-kickoff-call],
on the 23rd of every month at 6pm CET / 9am PST (unless it's on a weekend, then it's the first working day of the week after).

We look forward to reading all your comments on these documents and to
see your face in the calls!
