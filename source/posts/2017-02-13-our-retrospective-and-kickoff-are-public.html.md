As stated in the [GitLab Master Plan][gitlab-master-plan], we strive to maintain
a high level of [transparency]((https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/)).

That's why today we are making our release retrospective / kickoff notes and
calls public.

## The retrospective meeting

After each release (usually on the 23rd of each month), we have a retrospective
call where we discuss what went well, what went wrong, and what we can improve
for the next release. The [retrospective notes] are public and you are invited
to comment them.
If you're interested, you can even join the
[retrospective call][retro-kickoff-call], every 8th at 6pm CET / 9am PST
(unless it's on a weekend, then it's the first workday of the week after).

## The kickoff meeting

Before working on the next release (usually on the 8th of each month), we have a
kickoff call to explain what we expect to ship in the next release. The
[kickoff notes] are public and you are invited to comment them.
If you're interested, you can even join the [kickoff call][retro-kickoff-call],
every 23th at 6pm CET / 9am PST (unless it's on a weekend, then it's the first
workday of the week after).

## The 8.16 retrospective and 8.17 kickoff call

We are looking forward to reading all your comments on these documents and to
see your face in the calls!
