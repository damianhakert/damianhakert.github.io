      What are GitLab Issue Boards?
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-1", "feature-icon", { label: "One tool, endless functionality" })
      %h3
        One tool, endless functionality
      %p
        Everything in one place. Track issues and communicate progress without switching between products. One interface to follow your issues from backlog to done.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-2", "feature-icon", { label: "Beautiful and comprehensive" })
      %h3
        Beautiful and comprehensive
      %p
        It’s more than a visual representation. It’s your issues, your labels, and all the metadata that comes with them. And you still have all the same sorting and filtering tools that you use across GitLab.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-3", "feature-icon", { label: "Flexible setup" })
      %h3
        Flexible setup
      %p
        You define your process and we organize it. You create the label. We create the corresponding column and pull in your existing issues. When you're ready you drag and drop from one step to the next.

                :markdown
                  [Labels](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html) make it easy to
                  categorize issues based on descriptive titles. They help teams quickly understand
                  the context of an issue. Labels can be used to describe the issue type, like
                  "new feature," or describe the issue stage, like "QA."

                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    Create your first label: it's simple, you can create it from
                    [within the issue](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html#create-a-new-label-right-from-the-issue-tracker)
                    itself or by navigating to the [labels area](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html#create-new-labels).
                    If you already have some labels, it's time to meet the Issue Board!
      .step.js-step
        .container
          .step-icon-container
            = icon("issue-boards/icon-step-3", "step-icon step-icon-3", { label: "Go to your board" })

              %h3.step-title.text-center
                Go to your Issue Board
              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text
                :markdown
                  Issues appear as cards on the Issue Board. They can be arranged
                  across a number of columns called lists.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    Find your Issue Board by navigating to your project's **Issues > Board**.
                    By default, there's a list called Backlog, where you'll find all the issues
                    in that project, and there's a list called Done, which will contain all
                    the issues that have already been closed. Now let's create some new lists.
                .col-md-6.step-image-container
                  .step-image
                    = image_tag "/images/issue-boards/step-3-go-to-board.png", class: "img-responsive"
      .step.js-step
        .container
          .step-icon-container
            = icon("issue-boards/icon-step-4", "step-icon", { label: "Create a list based on a label" })
            %span.step-number.text-center
              [ step 04 ]
          .row
            .col-md-10.col-md-push-1.step-content-holder
              %h3.step-title.text-center
                Create a new list
              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text
                :markdown
                  Lists are based on the labels already created for your project. Each list contains
                  the issues that are assigned to the corresponding label.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-image-container
                  .step-image
                    = image_tag "/images/issue-boards/step-4-create-list.png", class: "img-responsive"
                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    Click **Create new list** and choose a label to create the list from.
                    Once done, the list will appear as a new column in your board, and the issues
                    assigned to that label will be automatically moved from Backlog to your new list.

                    If you are starting fresh, you can opt-in and let GitLab create a predefined set
                    of lists for you. You can create up to 10 lists per Issue Board.

                    You can also drag-and-drop the lists themselves, to organize them in a flow you'd like to work with.
      .step.js-step
        .container
          .step-icon-container
            = icon("issue-boards/icon-step-5", "step-icon", { label: "Drag and drop to organize issues" })
            %span.step-number.text-center
              [ step 05 ]
          .row
            .col-md-10.col-md-push-1.step-content-holder
              %h3.step-title.text-center
                Move issues between lists
              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text.step-lead-text-last
                :markdown
                  Communicate progress on your release by dragging and dropping issues from one column to another.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                     Move an issue between two columns and watch as the labels swap to represent the new column.

                     Every time you create a new issue with any of the labels you used in your lists, the issue
                     will be automatically displayed on your Issue Board. If you move it to **Done**, the issue
                     will be automatically closed for you!
                .col-md-6.step-image-container
                  .step-image
                    = image_tag "/images/issue-boards/step-5-drag-and-drop.png", class: "img-responsive"
