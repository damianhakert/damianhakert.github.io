      What are GitLab Issue Boards?
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-1", "feature-icon", { label: "One tool, endless functionality" })
      %h3
        One tool, endless functionality
      %p
        Everything in one place. Track issues and communicate progress without switching between products. One interface to follow your issues from backlog to done.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-2", "feature-icon", { label: "Beautiful and comprehensive" })
      %h3
        Beautiful and comprehensive
      %p
        It’s more than a visual representation. It’s your issues, your labels, and all the metadata that comes with them. And you still have all the same sorting and filtering tools that you use across GitLab.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-3", "feature-icon", { label: "Flexible setup" })
      %h3
        Flexible setup
      %p
        You define your process and we organize it. You create the label. We create the corresponding column and pull in your existing issues. When you're ready you drag and drop from one step to the next.

                    Navigate to the **Issues** tab under your project's page
                    and create your first issue. If your project already has
                    some issues, jump right to the next step!

                :markdown
                  [Labels](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html) provide
                  an easy way to categorize issues. Issue Boards are based on labels,
                  so this is an important step.

                  :markdown
                    Creating your first label is simple! You can create it from
                    [within the issue](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html#create-a-new-label-right-from-the-issue-tracker)
                    itself or by navigating to the [labels area](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/labels.html#create-new-labels).
                    If you already have some labels, it's time to meet the Issue Board!

              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text
                :markdown
                  The Issue Board consists of a number of columns called lists and each
                  list contains the issues that are are treated as cards.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    Find the Issue Board by navigating to your project's **Issues > Board**.
                    You can create lists which are based on the labels that already
                    exist in your issue tracker. Issues can be seen as cards and they can
                    easily be moved between the lists, as to create workflows.

              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text
                :markdown
                  Lists are based on the labels already created for your project. Each
                  list contains the issues that are assigned to the corresponding label.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-image-container
                  .step-image

                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    You start by having two special lists: **Backlog** and **Done**. Under
                    **Backlog** you can see all issues that are not yet assigned to a list.
                    The **Done** list, will close the relevant issue.

                    Click **Create new list** and you'll get to choose a label to create
                    the list from. Once done, the list will appear as a new column in your
                    board. You can create up to 10 lists per project.

                    If you are starting fresh, you can opt-in and let GitLab
                    create a predefined set of lists for you.
      .step.js-step
        .container
          .step-icon-container
            = icon("issue-boards/icon-step-5", "step-icon", { label: "Drag and drop to organize issues" })
            %span.step-number.text-center
              [ step 05 ]
          .row
            .col-md-10.col-md-push-1.step-content-holder
              %h3.step-title.text-center
                Move issues between lists
              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text.step-lead-text-last
                :markdown
                  Every issue is displayed in a card which you can drag and
                  drop to a different list in order to organize your project.
              .row.row-eq-height
                .col-md-6.step-content
                  :markdown
                    Move a card between two lists and the relevant issue will
                    get its labels swapped.

                    When you create a new issue and add a label to it which
                    corresponds to an existing list, that issue will be automatically
                    displayed on that list in your board. If you move it to **Done**,
                    the issue will be automatically closed for you!

                    You can also drag-and-drop the lists themselves, to organize
                    them in a flow you'd like to work with.
                .col-md-6.step-image-container
                  .step-image
                    = image_tag "/images/issue-boards/step-5-drag-and-drop.png", class: "img-responsive"
