        <h2>GitLab Enterprise Edition License keys FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Why does GitLab use licenses?</h3>
            <p>
                The code for Enterprise Edition is can be open to inspect for everyone.
                This makes it easier to offer a trial of Enterprise Edition.
            </p>

        <h3>Can anyone download GitLab EE?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, but it will not be functional without a license key.
            </p>

        <h3>How does the license key affect customers?</h3>
            <p>
                Customers can now download and inspect the code for the latest GitLab EE version for free.
                However, they cannot use it without a valid subscription.
                They also cannot make any modification to the GitLab EE code.
            </p>

        <h3>What does the license key work?</h3>
            <p>
                The license key is a static file which, upon uploading, allows GitLab Enterprise Edition to run.
                During license upload we check that the active users on your GitLab Enterprise Edition instance doesn't exceed the new number of users.
                During the licensed period you may add as many users as you want.
                The license key will expire after one year for GitLab subscribers.
            </p>

        <h3>How do I upgrade GitLab EE to 7.11 or above?</h3>
            <p>
                After you upgrade GitLab to EE version 7.11 and higher, GitLab EE will stop working without a license key.
                If you donâ€™t have a license key, please contact sales@gitlab.com and request a key.
                Once you deploy the key, then GitLab EE will start functioning again.
            </p>

        <h3>How do I know when my subscription is about to expire?</h3>
            <p>
                During the last 30 days of the subscription GitLab will display a renew countdown in the admin panel.
                During the next 14 days after the expiration date GitLab will display a renew countdown to all users.
            </p>

        <h3>What happens if I add more users than I've paid for?</h3>
            <p>
                GitLab Enteprise Edition will continue to run normally and you can add more users to it without restriction.
                However, we are following a true-up model.
                Upon renewal, you will pay for the additional users in the previous year, at half price.
            </p>
        
        <h3>Do I need an additional license if I run more than one server?</h3>
            <p>
                No, if your GitLab Enterprise Edition servers cover the same users, you can use the same license file for all of them.
            </p>

        <h3>What happens if I decide to not renew my subscription?</h3>
            <p>
                14 days after the end of your subscription, your key will no longer work and GitLab Enterprise Edition will not be functional anymore.
                You will be able to downgrade to GitLab Community Edition, which is free to use.
