title: "GitLab Direction"
---

This page list the direction or roadmap of GitLab.
It is organized from the short to the long term.

## Your contributions

GitLab's direction is determined by the code that is sent by our [contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/).
We continually merge code to be released in the next version.
Contributing is the best way to get a feature you want included.
In [our feedback forum](http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general),
many requests are made for features and changes to GitLab.
The ones with the
[status accepting merge requests](http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general/status/796455)
are preapproved.
Of course before any code is merged it still has to meet the
[contribution acceptance criteria](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-acceptance-criteria).

## What our customers want

At GitLab the company we try to make what our users and we need (many of us are or used to be developers).
But if a customer of us requests a feature that carries extra weight.
Due to our short release cycle we can ship simple feature requests (for example an api extension) within one to two months.

## Next releases

GitLab releases a new version every single month on the 22nd.
Note that we often move things around, do things that are not listed and we don't always get to do everything that is planned.
Also the list below not include any contributions from outside GitLab the company.
The version numbers below link to the issues for that version accross all products.
The bullets list the tentpole features; the most improtant features of upcoming releases.

## Vision <a name="vision"></a>

Everyone, including all knowledge workers, needs to collaborate on digital content.
This content should be open to suggestions by a wide number of potential contributors.
This can be achieved by using a mergeable file format and distributed version control.
The vision of GitLab is to <b>allow everyone to collaborate on all digital content</b>.
This allows people to cooperate effectively and to achieve better results, faster.

Idea's go flow though many stages before they are realized: chat, issue, sprint, IDE, commit, CI, review, acceptance, deployment.
Stitching all stages together can be done in many different ways.
You can have a marketplace of proprietary apps from different suppliers.
Or stich it together with a suite of products that are developed in isolation.
We believe that an <b>integrated set of tools based on convention over configuration</b> offers a superior user experience.
The advantage can be quoted from the [Wikipedia page for convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration): "decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, and not necessarily losing flexibility.".
In GitLab you only have to specify unconventional aspects of your workflow, the rest will be a smooth experience.
And that smooth experience should go all the way from informal chat, to creating an issue, coding it in an IDE, committing the code, running CI tests, doing a code review, to deployment in different environments.
That doesn't mean we'll never do a marketplace, in fact this is the way [GitLab.com will be free forever](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/#why-gitlab-com-will-be-free-forever).
But we admire other convention over configuration tools like [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and strive to offer the same advantages for a continuous delivery of software.

The open source nature of GitLab ensures that we're well suited to offer an integrated experience.
Everyone can contribute to achieve the [complete feature set](https://about.gitlab.com/comparison/) that is needed for an integrated experience.
Because GitLab is open source the enhancements can become part of the codebase instead of being external.
This ensures the automated tests for all functionality are continually run, ensuring that plugins always work.
It also ensures GitLab can continue to evolve with it's plugins instead of being bound to a plugin API that is hard to change and that resists refactoring.
This ensures we have many years of quality code and great monthly releases ahead of us.
