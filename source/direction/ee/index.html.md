# Introduction

At GitLab we have a vision to change how teams ship softwares. We call it From 
Idea to production, and we believe anyone can do ship an idea quickly, in
production, with our tool: GitLab, the best free, open-source platform available
on the market today.

In order to achieve this bold vision and make a better product each month, we
need revenues. They will come from the Enterprise Edition. The math is simple:
the more money we make with the Enterprise Edition, the better all GitLab
versions, especially the Community Edition, will be.

To better serve the market, GitLab will come in 4 editions.

## Different flavours for different needs and sizes

* **Community Edition**: this is the foundation of everything we do and why
we exist, as a company. All the Enterprise Editions are based on CE. CE is
simply the best open-source developer tool out there, and we will continue to
make it even better every month. Our objective is that our Idea to production
vision is achievable with our free version. CE is aimed at solo developers as
well as a small team of developers.
* **Enterprise Edition Starter**: this edition is aimed towards teams of
developers (100 or more users). It includes enterprise features for developers,
like merge request approvals mechanism for instance, or repositories mirroring
- features that you are more likely to find in large organizations. It also
includes features for the managers of these teams, like reporting, or group
management functionalities.
* **Enterprise Edition Premium**: aimed towards large organizations (750+ users)
 or geographically distributed teams. This edition contains features for
 instance administrators, managers of very large teams that want to take actions
  across different teams, and people other than developers who actively
  participate in the life of a software, like QA testers or support agents. It
  also contains features that help teams that are not in the same physical
  locations, like Geo.
* **Enterprise Edition Ultimate**: aimed towards very large organizations
(5000+ users). This edition bundles tools that help to work without any
interruption (High availability, Active/active setups), or be in complete
control over the change management within their organization (Canary deploys,
  feature enablement). Finally, this edition is for corporations with various
  compliances and certifications.
