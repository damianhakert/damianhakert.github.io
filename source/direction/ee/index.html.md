GitLab comes in 4 editions:

* **Community Edition**: aimed at solo developers as well as a small team of
developers. All the Enterprise Editions are based on CE. Our objective is that
our Idea to production vision is achievable with our free version.
* **Enterprise Edition Starter**: aimed towards teams of developers (100 or more
users). It includes enterprise features that you are more likely to find in
large organizations. It also includes features for managers of these teams, like
reporting, or group management functionalities.
* **Enterprise Edition Premium**: aimed towards large organizations (750+ users)
or geographically distributed teams. This edition contains features for
instance administrators, managers of very large teams that want to take actions
across different teams, and people other than developers who actively
participate in the life of a software, like QA testers or support agents. It
also contains features that help teams that are not in the same physical
locations.
* **Enterprise Edition Ultimate**: aimed towards very large organizations (5000+
users). This edition bundles tools that help to work without any interruption,
or be in complete control over the change management within their organization.
Finally, this edition is for corporations with various compliances and
certifications.
