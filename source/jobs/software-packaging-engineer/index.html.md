## Responsibilities

* As a Software Packaging engineer your main focus will be GitLab packaging project,
[omnibus-gitlab][]
* Work on improving various aspects of the omnibus-gitlab package (size, speed, reliability)
* Implement and bundle new services into the omnibus-gitlab package, for more details see our [direction scope][]
* Work with the rest of the GitLab development team in supporting newly created features and resolving bugs on the omnibus-gitlab project side
* Work on making GitLab easier to install and configure for all users (through Chef cookbooks, Puppet modules, Ansible and Salt scripts)
* Improve package build processes
* Help community packaging projects (eg. native Debian, native Fedora and native Arch packages)


## Requirements for Applicants
(Check our [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page to see current openings).

* Linux experience, comfortable between Debian and RHEL based systems
* Chef experience
* Programming experience (Ruby and Ruby on Rails preferred; for GitLab debugging)
* Knowledge of container ecosystems (Docker, rkt, etc.)
* Packaging experience is an advantage, not a requirement. However, you are expected to have basic knowledge
of at least .deb and .rpm package archives.
* Collaborative team spirit with good communication skills
* Work remotely from anywhere in the world (Curious to see what that looks like? Check out our [remote manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)!)

## Workflow

In cooperation with the Packaging team, issues to work on will be sorted per release cycle.

Deciding priority of the issues can be found in [the handbook under GitLab Workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#prioritize).
