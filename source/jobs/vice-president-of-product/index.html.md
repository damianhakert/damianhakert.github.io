## Development direction

- Manage CE / EE / CI features: make sure a release contains attractive new features.
- Manage customer requests: take load of support for handling this and making sure we deliver
- Create direction in development efforts: Making sure that our long term goals are closer with each release
- Make sure other products (license, version) are not snowed under with the release
- Handle feature requests from sales
- Ensure that we translate user demands in features that make them happy but keep the product UI clean and the codebase maintainable
