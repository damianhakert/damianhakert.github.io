* When done with an UX issue remove the UX label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) which is probably the 'Frontend' label.
* Also see the [basics of GitLab development in the developer onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/developer-onboarding/#basics-of-gitlab-development).

### UX Interview Questions <a name="ux-interview-questions"></a>

The UX Interview determines if a UX Designer is a good fit for GitLab. Here are some questions we might ask:

1. What is your design process?
1. Similarly, what is your flow from idea to deployment?
1. What are some existing designs we can see as an example of you work?
1. When you did `x` project, what was the biggest problem that you had to solve and how did you solve it?
