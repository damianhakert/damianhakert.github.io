## Tools

## Workflow

* You work on issues tagged with 'UX' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux).
* When done with an UX issue remove the UX label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) which is probably the 'Frontend' label.
* Also see the [basics of GitLab development in the developer onboarding](handbook/developer-onboarding/#basics-of-gitlab-development).

* You communicate well with the developers.
* You are contributing ideas and solutions beyond existing issues.
* Users are overwhelmingly happy about your contributions.
* You collaborate effectively with Frontend Engineers, Developers, and Designers.

## Roles in practice
