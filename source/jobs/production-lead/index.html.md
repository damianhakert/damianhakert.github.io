## Why Parity?

If we don't translate our learnings from running and scaling GitLab.com (the
largest GitLab-EE installation) into a default setting we will be making really
expensive mistakes.

Consider the [GitLabFan
case](https://gitlabfan.com/onboarding-story-importing-projects-from-gitlab-com-to-self-hosted-gitlab-9ded5eb80f2f#.yy6bs3fs0)
when a customer tried to import his projects into an on-premise installation
and found multiple blockers in the way, including one that simply should not be
there: limitation of 10 projects per user.

This frustrated this customer, and he/she is right, we can do much better.
