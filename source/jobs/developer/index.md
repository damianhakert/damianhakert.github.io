At GitLab, developers are highly independent and self-organized individual
contributors who work together as a tight team in a [remote and agile](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/14/remote-agile-at-gitlab/) way.

## General Developer Responsibilities

* Develop features from request to polished end result.
* Support our [service engineers](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/service-engineer) in getting to the bottom of user-reported issues and come up with robust solutions.
* Engage with the rest of the core team and the open source community and collaborate on improving GitLab.
* Review code contributed by the rest of the community and work with them to get it ready for production.
* Write documentation around features and configuration to save our users time.
* Take initiative in improving the software in small or large ways to address pain points in your own experience as a developer.
* Keep code easy to maintain and keep it easy for others to contribute code to GitLab.
* Qualify developers for hiring.

### Responsibilities Split Between Various Developers

* Omnibus packaging
* Chef cookbooks
* DevOps: ensuring that deployments are smooth and scalable
* Maintenance of various servers such as
   * license.gitlab.com
   * version.gitlab.com
   * status.gitlab.com
   * doc.gitlab.com
   * dev.gitlab.org
* Feature development for GitLab CE, EE, and CI.

### Senior Developers

Senior Developers are experienced developers who:

* know a domain really well and radiate that knowledge
* train new people
* are the go-to person when people on the team have development questions

## Workflow

You work on issues tagged with 'Developer' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=Developer) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name=Developer).
Some issues might be missing any [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) but be ready for a developer, in this case feed free to add 'Developer' label.

The priority of the issues tagged with this label can be found in [the handbook under GitLab Workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#prioritize).

When done with an issue remove the 'Developer' label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) or create a merge request and assign it someone that has 'Merge request endboss' on their [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/) listing.
