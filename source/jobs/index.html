      </h2>

      <p>
        GitLab B.V. is growing quickly and we would love to grow our team with a Junior Service Engineer.
        The rising popularity of GitLab means that our professional services are in high demand.
        If you got the skills to help to our clients we would love to talk to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because most of our clients are in the United States you will need to be in a timezone near there.
        We are open to candidates who are located from Pacific Standard Time (-8) to Atlantic Standard Time (-4).
        If you are a vampire you can be located from Moscow Standard Time (+4) to Singapore Time (+8).
        We're open to candidates from both inside and outside the United States.
      </p>

      <h4>Responsibilities:</h4>

      <p>
        You would be engaging with our customers, this can be anything from as small advertising firm, a university
        to Fortune 100 clients. This will be mostly via email, but you will also have video conferences with them
        when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will also help our Community Manager with questions coming from Twitter and Facebook and respond to questions
        on the GitLab.com Support Forum.
        When you do not have an appointment you engage with the rest of the core team to improve GitLab.
        You fix problems, add features, improve documentation, polish the website and engage with people on various forums.
      </p>


      <h4>Requirements</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>B.Sc. in Computer Science or equivalent experience</li>
        <li>Above average knowledge of Unix and Unix based Operating Systems</li>
        <li>1+ years of programming experience (Ruby and Ruby on Rails preferred)</li>
        <li>Good people skills</li>
        <li>Excellent spoken and written English</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At GitLab B.V. we mostly work from home and love to go to Rails conferences (paid for by GitLab B.V.).
        We are looking for people who can handle and enjoy the freedom that comes with working from home.
        Our water coolers are Slack and a daily Hangout.
      </p>

      <h3>Day in the life</h3>

      <p>
        A typical day as service engineer for GitLab starts with the weekly morning meeting.
        As you have a lot of contact with our customers, it's your task during the meeting to call everyone else to duty.
        After the meeting, you provide support to large companies using GitLab. Rather than answering everything
        quickly, you'll spend most of your time fixing bugs in GitLab, helping customers with complex scaling problems
        and if you can't solve it yourself, working with your colleagues on the issue at hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, you'll get access into the system of our customers to solve problems on the spot or call with them
        to discuss their plans of using GitLab.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides support, you'll be looking for ways to improve GitLab in any facet. You might want to build a new
        feature, improve the website (yes please!) or initiate something new. You'll also be asked to manage our
        GitLab.com instance, where thousands of users push and pull happily every day, and have to help with releasing
        GitLab every month on the 22nds.
      </p>

      <p>
        GitLab is a booming startup in every sense of the word. You can do anything and there is more to do than
        hands are available. Everything you do will be something someone else doesn't have the time for or didn't
        have the time to think about. You'll make a significant change in the company.
