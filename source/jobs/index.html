    <h1>Interaction Engineer
      <small>Remote</small>
    </h1>

    <p>
      GitLab BV is looking someone that can make GitLab look and feel even better.
      We recognize by the success of Apple and Slack that design and
      usability is as important as solid engineering.
      As interaction engineer, you will be responsible for setting a higher standard in usability and
      design in GitLab.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're looking for someone that can create mockups quickly and implement
      these themselves. You have to have an eye for clean design and understand
      what makes an application easy to use and feel good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone in GitLab works very independently. You will have to be able to
      come up with your own improvements and will be responsible for their full
      implementation, start to finish. We often work on a consultancy basis for
      customers, which means you'll work together with the other engineers to
      implement features on request.
    </p>

    <p>
      GitLab is a booming startup, meaning there is much more work than hands
      available. As first interaction engineer, everything you do will have
      a major impact on the experience of everyone that uses GitLab: hundreds
      of thousands of organisations.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll need to be familiar with HTML, CSS and JS. Besides jQuery
      we don't use many JS libraries or frameworks, but we welcome any experience
      in one (Ember, Angular, etc). GitLab is built on Bootstrap 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're a distributed company and you'll mainly work remote.
      We welcome candidates from all countries between Pacific time and
      Eastern European time (North America, South America, Europe and Africa).
      Most of our customers are in the continental U.S. time zones.
      We're considering opening an office in San Francisco in the coming years.
