        <h2>Interaction Engineer
          <small>Remote</small>
        </h2>

        <p>
          GitLab BV is looking for someone that can make GitLab look and feel even better.
          We recognize from the success of Apple and Slack that design and
          usability is as important as solid engineering.
          As interaction engineer, you will be responsible for setting a higher standard in usability and
          design in GitLab.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're looking for someone that can create mockups quickly and implement
          these themselves. You have to have an eye for clean design and understand
          what makes an application easy to use and feel good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Employees at Gitlab work independently and you will have to be responsible
          for coming up with your own improvements as well as for their full implementation,
          start to finish. In addition, we often work on a consultancy basis for customers
          and this position requires the ability to collaborate with other engineers to
          implement feeatures on request.
        </p>

        <p>
          GitLab is a booming startup, meaning there is much more work than hands
          available. As first interaction engineer, everything you do will have
          a major impact on the experience of everyone that uses GitLab: hundreds
          of thousands of organizations.
