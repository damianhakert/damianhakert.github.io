## Priorities

You work on items tagged with 'Frontend' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=frontend) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name=frontend).

The priority starting from urgent is:

0. @mentions from team members and the rest of the community
1. Issues assigned to the upcoming milestone
2. Issues assigned to future milestones
3. Issues not assigned to a milestone

When done with an ux issue remove the ux label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) which is probably the 'Developer' label.
