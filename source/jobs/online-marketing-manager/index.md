## Available Openings

### Developer
* [Description](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/developer/)
* [Apply](https://gitlab.workable.com/jobs/106660/candidates/new)
* As part of our technical interview<a name="technical-interview"></a>, you will
be asked to pick an issue from the GitLab CE issue tracker, and code 'live' with
the interviewer there to talk with and collaborate with. We do this because we
believe that it is the best way for you to see what the work is really like, and
for our [interviewer to see how you think, code, and collaborate](http://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/#collaborate).
When contributing code, you should follow the [Contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and you agree to the [individual contributor license agreement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md).
If you prefer not to do the above please let us know and we'll give you an assignment that does not relate to GitLab but does test the relevant skills.
* If you get in the [contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/) top 10 we'll
  hire you (at least that is what has happened so far).
* We normally don't offer any internships but if you get a couple of merge requests
  accepted we'll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without
  supervision, you'll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to
  work on open source and qualify please [submit an application](https://gitlab.workable.com/jobs/207439/candidates/new).
  In the cover letter field please note that you want an internship and link to
  the accepted merge requests. The merge requests should be of significant
  value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For
  example, fixing 10 typos isn't as valuable as shipping 2 new features.
