## Workflow

- You work on issues tagged with 'Frontend' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=Frontend) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name=Frontend).
- The priority of the issues tagged with this label can be found in [the handbook under GitLab Workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#prioritize).
- When done with a frontend issue remove the 'Frontend' label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) which is probably the 'Developer' label.

## Internships
We normally don't offer any internships, but if you get a couple of merge requests
accepted, we'll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without
supervision; you'll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to
work on open source and qualify please [submit an application](https://gitlab.workable.com/jobs/106660/candidates/new).
In the cover letter field, please note that you want an internship and link to
the accepted merge requests. The merge requests should be of significant
value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For
example, fixing 10 typos isn't as valuable as shipping 2 new features.
