## Workflow

You work on issues tagged with 'Frontend' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=Frontend) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?label_name=Frontend).

The priority of the issues tagged with this label can be found in [the handbook under GitLab Workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#prioritize).

When done with a frontend issue remove the 'Frontend' label and add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) which is probably the 'Developer' label.
