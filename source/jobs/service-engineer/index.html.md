### Junior Service Engineer

Junior Service Engineers share the same responsibilities outlined above, but typically
join with less or alternate experience in one of the key areas of Service Engineering
expertise (SysAdmin skills, Ruby on Rails, Git, and customer service). For example,
a person with extensive experience in a web framework other than RoR, but with experience
on the other three areas would typically join as a Junior.

### Senior Service Engineer

Senior Service Engineers are more experienced engineers who meet the following
criteria:

- Technical Skills
  - Can solve most support tickets in a reasonable time without escalating to development
  - Expert in most [advanced topics](/handbook/support/advanced-topics) (e.g. LDAP, Jenkins/CI integration, Geo)
  - Deep understanding of GitLab internals and a variety of possible configurations
  - Debug challenging problems
  - Submit merge requests to resolve GitLab bugs
- Leadership
  - Help hire and train new Service Engineers
  - Become a go-to person for the other Service Engineers when they face tough challenges
- Communication
  - Take ownership of improving documentation
  - Lead by example in terms of solving a customer issue, updating documentation as a result, and then radiating this knowledge through a blog post
  - Drive feature requests based on customer interactions
- Suggest and implement improvements to the support workflow
- Contribute to one or more complementary projects

### Staff Engineer

A Senior Service Engineer will be promoted to Staff Service Engineer when he/she has
demonstrated significant leadership and impact; typically around resolving customer issues. This may
involve any type of consistent "above and beyond senior level" performance, for example:

1. Regularly submitting merge requests for customer reported/requested GitLab bugs and feature proposals
1. Working across functional groups to deliver on projects relating to customer experience and success.
1. Writing in-depth documentation and clarifying community communications that share knowledge and radiate GitLab's technical strengths
1. The ability to create innovative solutions that push GitLab's technical abilities ahead of the curve
1. Identifying significant projects that result in substantial cost savings or revenue
1. Proactively defining and solving important architectural issues
