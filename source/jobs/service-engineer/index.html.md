### Junior Service Engineer

Junior Service Engineers share the same responsibilities outlined above, but typically
join with less or alternate experience in one of the key areas of Service Engineering
expertise (SysAdmin skills, Ruby on Rails, Git, and customer service). For example,
a person with extensive experience in a web framework other than RoR, but with experience
on the other three areas would typically join as a Junior.
