## Development direction

- Manage CE / EE / CI features: make sure a release is more than bug fixes
- Manage customer requests: take load of support for handling this and making sure we deliver
- Create direction in development efforts: Making sure that our long term goals are closer with each release
- Make sure other products (license, version) are not snowed under with the release

## Bridge development - sales - marketing

- Give demos to customers
- Make sure marketing puts out correct information
- Shield development from sales and vice versa: be a first responder to questions to the other side
- answer feature questions on social media (twitter, stack overflow,

## Public information

- Guard the quality of any public materials, such as documentation and tweets
mailinglist)
- keep the feature request tracker up to date
- make sure developers write good docs for every function
- make sure the CE/EE comparison, GitHub comparison and battlecards
are up to date
- ensure that answers to internal questions end up being documented publicly
- Make /direction more of a high level roadmap (can link to public issues now)
- Move most of the issues from dev to .com (so our internal roadmap is public)

## Customer relations

- join customer visits if they can lead to new features
- join partner visits if they can lead to new features
