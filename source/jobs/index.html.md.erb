## Technical interview<a name="technical-interview"></a>

For some positions, the hiring process includes a technical interview. As part of our technical interview, you will
be asked to pick an issue from the GitLab CE issue tracker, and code 'live' with
the interviewer there to talk with and collaborate with. We do this because we
believe that it is the best way for you to see what the work is really like, and
for our [interviewer to see how you think, code, and collaborate](http://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/#collaborate).
When contributing code, you should follow the [Contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and you agree to the [individual contributor license agreement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md).
If you prefer not to do the above please let us know and we'll give you an assignment that does not relate to GitLab but does test the relevant skills.

## Equal Employment Opportunity Statement
