## Technical interview<a name="technical-interview"></a>

For some positions, the hiring process includes a technical interview.
In the technical interview, you will work on an issue from the
[GitLab Community Edition issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues)
in a 1-hour screen sharing session with the interviewer, and code 'live', with
them there to talk and collaborate with.

After the interview, you will be asked to spend some time to finish the work,
get it as close to
[done](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#definition-of-done)
as your time allows, and submit a merge request with the changes to the GitLab CE project.
The interviewer will then review it, leave feedback, and ask you to look at the feedback
and potentially make changes to the merge request to address it.
After at most 2 cycles of review by the interviewer and changes by you,
the interviewer will let you know whether GitLab will move forward with your candidacy, or not.

The work on the merge request after the actual technical interview is expected to
take between 1 and 3 hours in total. While this often will not be a problem, you
are encouraged to let the interviewer know when you feel like you are getting
close to having spent more time on the merge request than is reasonable.
In this case, they will make a decision on your candidacy then, based on the information gathered during the
technical interview and the work on the merge request up to that point.

We do this because we believe that it is the best way for you to see what the work is really like, and
for our interviewer to see how you [think, code, and collaborate](http://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/#collaborate).

Once the merge request is finished, the code you have written will
go into the
[GitLab Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#community) to the
benefit of the millions of developers using this free, open-source product,
but will also go into the proprietary
[GitLab Enterprise Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#enterprise),
which is a fork thereof.
When contributing code, you should follow the [Contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and you agree to the [individual contributor license agreement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md).

If you prefer not to do the above, please let us know and we'll give you an
assignment that does not relate to GitLab but does test the relevant skills.
