## A day in the life of...

On a typical day, you may start by reading messages from team members in email and via our
chat channels. Team members are located all over the world, so there is always bound to be
a question waiting for you! During the morning [team call](https://about.gitlab.com/hanbook/communication/#team-call)
you'll hear all about what's new and what strange behavior some of the [team pets](https://about.gitlab.com/team-pets/) have gotten up to. You'll also
share important pieces of People Ops news with the team, and point out a new process to them
that you documented the day before on our extensive and public [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/). Next, it is time
for those screening calls with new applicants, and reference calls with applicants that
we are keen to add to the team. You're smoothly in and out of our applicant tracking system (Workable),
people ops information system (BambooHR), our handbook, and the internal issue tracker
where we post and solve issues together. Time for lunch; in your yard, or wherever you prefer.

One of the hiring managers pings People Ops for a contract for a new hire. You raise your
hand, and pull it off the [contracts page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) making the process as smooth and fast as possible
for the hiring manager, and the applicant; the contract is reviewed and sent out that day via HelloSign.
Next, you turn your attention to helping the new hire from yesterday get started with
onboarding. Now is the time to make some small but important edits to the
handbook, whether it is a suggested edit to our [company values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values), or a process involving BambooHR. As the business day comes to an end, you mark off the tasks that you've tackled
from the issue tracker, and make that restaurant reservation the executive team asked
for via Slack just a short moment ago. You can't wait for tomorrow, because that's
when you'll start improving our performance review processes! You are awesome.
