title: "Production Engineer"
---

A production engineer is a developer with who thinks deeply about systems and
how they behave in the wild. Whether it be networking, or the Linux kernel,
or even a specific interest in scaling, algorithms, or distributed systems.

It could also be seen as a systems engineer who aims to code themselves out of
a job by automating all the things, learning to leverage great development
practices like TDD or continous integration (to start with).

## As a production engineer you will:

* Be on a PagerDuty rotation to respond to GitLab.com availability incidents and
  Provide support for service engineers with customer incidents.
* Use your oncall rotation to prevent pages from ever happening.
* Manage our infrastructure with Chef, Terraform and Kubernetes.
* Make monitoring and alerting alert on symptoms and not on outages.
* [Document every action](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks) so your learnings turn in repeatable actions and then on automation.
* Improve the deployment process to make it as boring as possible.
* Design, build and maintain core infrastructure pieces that allow GitLab scaling to support hundred of thousands of concurrent users.
* Debug production issues across services and levels of the stack.
* Plan the growth of GitLab's infrastructure.
* Ship every solution into the GitLab-CE and EE package as a default.

## You may be a fit to this role if you:

* Think about systems - edge cases, failure modes, behaviors, specific implementations.
* Know your way around linux and the Unix Shell.
* Have an interest in distributed systems and a solid understanding of how modern web stacks are built, and why.
* Know what is the use of config management systems like Chef (the one we use)
* Have strong programing skills - Ruby and/or Go (for operations and infrastructure projects respectively)
* Have a sense for scale either.
* Hold yourself to a high bar when working in production environments.
* Have an urge to collaborate and communicate asynchronously.
* Have a proactive, go-for-it attitude. When you see something broken, you can't help
  but fix it.
* Have an urgency for delivering quickly and iterating fast.
* You share our [values](/handbook/#values), and work in accordance with those
  values.

## Projects you could work on:

* Building a distributed system like [Gitaly](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly)
* Coding infrastructure automation with [Chef](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/)
* Improving our [Prometheus Monitoring](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab-prometheus) or building new [Metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-monitor)
* Building the [automation to scale out](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/892) and scaling out our fleet.
* Building [chatops bundles for COG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-cog/) to automate ourselves out of a job.
* Helping building and maintaining core GitLab.com infrastructure pieces like [GitLab Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse/)
* Helping drive production ready large scale features.
* Helping release managers deploying and troubleshooting new versions of GitLab-EE.
* Helping the build team to ship complex pieces of infrastructure in a way that just work out of the box.
* Whatever is on the [infrastructure issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues) and you feel passionate about.
