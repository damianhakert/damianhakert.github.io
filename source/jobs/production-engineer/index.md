At GitLab, Production Engineers are highly independent and self-organized team
contributors in a [remote and agile](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/09/14/remote-agile-at-gitlab/) way.

A Production Engineer is a hybrid Software/System Engineer who ensure that GitLab.com
runs smoothly and have the capacity for future growth. Either you are a Developer who
loves to keep things running or a Systems Engineer who loves to code.

* Improve GitLab.com availability and performance
* Incident response for customers and for GitLab.com
* Making GitLab easier to maintain for engineers all over the world
* Manage our infrastructure with Chef (and a little Ansible)
* Improve monitoring systems
* Improve deployment processes
* Making GitLab.com scale as it grows

* Database experience (we use PostgreSQL and Redis)
* Chef experience
* Ability to code really well in at least one language (Ruby and Ruby on Rails preferred)
* Ability to learn new languages, technologies and tools quickly

You work on issues in the [operations repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/operations/issues).
