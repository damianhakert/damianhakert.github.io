As a GitLab Developer Advocate, your goal is to talk with developers to better understand our community and see how we can help make their GitLab experience better. You’ll be traveling to events, creating high-quality code complete tutorials to help our community collaborate more effectively, work to gather product feedback from the field, and doing everything in your power to keep GitLab in the minds of the developer community. We think [this](http://www.leggetter.co.uk/2016/02/03/defining-developer-relations.html) is a great overview of developer relations.

## Responsibilities

* Recognize trends in feedback from the community and relay that information back to our engineering and PM team.
* Put together technical presentations that keep attendees engaged and interested.
* Get on calls with our sales team and our customers to help solve a complex problem.

## Requirements for Applicants
