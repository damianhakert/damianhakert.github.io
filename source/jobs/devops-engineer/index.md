* GitLab.com performs better than the main competitor equivalent services.
* You communicate and collaborate well with the Developers and Service Engineers to 
enable 'devops-minded' development and customer-focused solutions.
* Your documentation is very complete and a delight to the eyes, but also properly organized so as not to reveal
security-sensitive information beyond the intended audience.
* SysAdmins across the globe are jubilant about the elegance of GitLab deployments.
