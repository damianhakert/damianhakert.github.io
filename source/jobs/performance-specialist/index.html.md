title: "Performance Specialist"
---

As a performance specialist you will be tasked with improving performance of
GitLab (all parts that it consists of) and the infrastructure powering
GitLab.com. You will be working on the GitLab Rails application, the various
components that it uses (e.g. gitlab-shell), as well as working on tuning
database configurations, adding monitoring, reducing system resources, making
architectural changes to improve performance and reduce costs, etc.

The team you will be a part of consists out of several performance specialists
and various production engineers. Members are spread across different countries
and time zones.

## Meetings

Every Monday and Thursday there's an infrastructure meeting starting at 16:00
UTC, usually lasting 10-15 minutes. These meetings are not standups, instead
they are meant to allow members to discuss topics on a high level and to get in
sync with each other. These meetings are not meant to give updates on the
progress of work, we use issues and merge requests for this.  While you don't
have to discuss something during every meeting you are expected to at least
attend whenever possible.

## As a performance specialist you will:

* Be on a PagerDuty rotation to respond to GitLab.com availability incidents and
  provide support for service engineers with customer incidents.
* Use your oncall rotation to prevent pages from ever happening, to understand
  what the main performance problems are, and proactively work on removing
  bottlenecks.
* Work on improving performance and resource usage of GitLab CE/EE and
  GitLab.com using the various tools provided by GitLab (see
  <https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/performance.html>).
* Improve monitoring and alerting, or build new solutions where necessary.
* Clearly document your findings in issues and merge requests.
* Improve performance related documentation whenever necessary.
* Be part of the infrastructure team, including the recurring meetings.
* Design new testing and analysis tools to prevent performance regressions from
  happening.
* Propose new tasks, features, or other changes to improve performance.
* Back all your ideas, proposals, and changes with data, obtained using either
  dedicated experiments or production monitoring systems.
* Propose and run experiments to better understand and plan/improve the design
  of GitLab's infrastructure for larger scales.

## You may be a fit to this role if you:

* Have at least 5 years of experience working with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec,
  and similar Ruby software.
* Have solid understanding of PostgreSQL and Redis.
* Are able to work in the open, remote, independently, and with colleagues in
  different timezones.
* Have a high proficiency in English, both in speaking and writing.
* Have experience with and interest in working on FOSS projects.
* Have a solid understanding of algorithm complexities, statistics (e.g.
  percentiles), and related subjects.
* Have an interest in distributed systems and a solid understanding of how
  modern web stacks are built, and why.
* Have an urge to document all the things so you don't need to learn the same
  thing twice.
* Share our [values](/handbook/#values), and work in accordance with those
  values.

Bonus points for:

* Having experience with Go and MySQL.
* Being able to work with Ubuntu.
* Having good understanding of Linux internals, in particular the tools provided
  (e.g. strace and Systemtap).
* Having experience with Ubuntu Linux as this is the Linux distribution we use
  for GitLab.com.
