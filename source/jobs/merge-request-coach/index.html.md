title: "Merge Request Coach"
---

The main goal of a Merge Request Coach is to make our community happy by giving
fast feedback and help [merge requests from the community].

A Merge Request Coach must be really strict about coding standards and best
practices since community contributors can spend a relatively little amount of
time adding a feature, but we will have to support it for the life of the
project, so it should be maintainable.

## Responsibilities

* Triage [merge requests from the community]
* Reject merge requests that we don't want with a clear explanation on the
  reasons why so that people don't feel discouraged
* Give feedback on [merge requests from the community], and help contributors
  to get their merge requests meet the [contribution acceptance criteria]
* Ensure [merge requests from the community] conform to our [various style guides]
* If the contributor is unresponsive or if they won't finish it, finish their
  merge request to meet the [contribution acceptance criteria]:
  * Close the original merge request and say that you will finish it
  * Check out the branch locally
  * Keep at least one original commit (you can squash commits if there are a lot)
    from the author
  * Make sure a changelog entry crediting the author exists
  * Add your own commits to improve and finish the original work
  * Push to a new branch and open a new merge request
* Reduce the amount of opened [merge requests from the community]
* Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby
