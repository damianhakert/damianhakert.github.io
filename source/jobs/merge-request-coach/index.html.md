title: "Merge Request Coach"
---

The main goal of a Merge Request Coach is to keep our community happy by giving
fast feedback and to help [merge requests from the community] get merged into
GitLab.

A Merge Request Coach is strict about coding standards and best practices. A
community member's job is often done once the contribution is merged, but we're
responsible for it for the life of the project, so it needs to be maintainable.

## Responsibilities

* Triage [merge requests from the community]
* Close merge requests that we don't want, with a clear explanation on the
  reasons why so that people don't feel discouraged
* Give feedback on [merge requests from the community], and help contributors
  to get their merge requests to meet the [contribution acceptance criteria]
* Ensure [merge requests from the community] conform to our [various style guides]
* If the contributor is unresponsive or if they are unable to finish it, finish
  their merge request to meet the [contribution acceptance criteria]:
  * Close the original merge request and say that you will finish it
  * Check out the branch locally
  * Keep at least one original commit (you can squash commits if there are a lot)
    from the author
  * Make sure a changelog entry crediting the author exists
  * Add your own commits to improve and finish the original work
  * Push to a new branch and open a new merge request
* Reduce the amount of open [merge requests from the community]
* Make it easy to contribute to GitLab even for people who are new to Ruby,
  JavaScript, or programming entirely
