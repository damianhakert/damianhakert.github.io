GitLab Inc. is a company based on the GitLab open-source project. GitLab is a community project to which over 1000
people worldwide have contributed. We are an active participant in this community, trying to serve its needs and lead
by example. We have one vision, everyone can contribute to all digital content and our mission is to change all
creative work from read-only to read-write so that everyone can contribute.  

We value results, transparency, sharing, freedom, efficiency, frugality, collaboration, directness, kindness, diversity,
boring solutions, and quirkiness.  If these values match your personality, work ethic and personal goals, we encourage you

truly unique.
