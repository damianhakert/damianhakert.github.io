          %ul
            %li Enter the building through the double doors between the two Mike's Bikes locations.
            %li
              On the intercom press the call button then press '206' (for GitLab) to have us buzz you in.
              %small Note: we press 0 to open the door from our cellphone.
            %li Proceed to the elevator at the rear of the foyer and press 2 to go to the 2nd floor (strangely the elevator will show 3 when you stop at 2).
            %li Exit the elevator and proceed to the right. The unit is the last door on the right at the end of the hall (2F).

          .tabbed-text
            Since we all work remotely at GitLab, we use team video calls regularly (with more than 50 people on most days!).
            Mostly only our CEO and
            %a{href: "/team-pets"}Suzy
            are in the Francisco office.
