          %h2 Overview
          %ul
            %li
              When development teams are spread across two or more teams geographical locations, but their
              GitLab instance is in a single location, fetching and cloning large repositories can take a long time.
            %li
              Built for distributed teams, GitLab Geo allows for read-only mirrors of your GitLab instance. Reduce
              the time it takes to clone and fetch large repos and improve your collaboration process.

          %h2 How it works
          %ul
            %li
              GitLab Geo is included in GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium.
            %li
              GitLab Geo allows for read-only mirrors of your GitLab instance.
            %li
              Project repositories and the database including user accounts,
              issues, merge requests, groups, project data, etc., are replicated on your secondary instance.
            %li
              With read-only mirrors, your team can fetch projects and read data much faster while still
              pushing all changes to the primary server.
            %li
              All replication operations are asynchronous and are queued to be dispatched as soon as they
              happen.

              %b Read-only secondaries:
              Maintain one primary GitLab instance while still enabling a read-only secondary
              instance for each of your distributed teams.
            %li
              %b Authentication system hooks:
              The secondary instance receives all authentication data, like user accounts
              and logins, from the primary instance.
            %li
              %b Intuitive UI:
              Secondaries utilize the same web interface your team has grown accustomed to. However, there
              are visual notifications that block write operations and make it clear that a user is on a
              secondary instance.

              %b Time:
              Reduce the time it takes your distributed developers to clone and fetch large repos and
              projects from minutes to seconds.
            %li
              %b Collaboration:
              Enable all of your developers to contribute ideas and work in parallel from each of their
              respective geographies.
            %li
              %b Scale:
              Balance the load between your primary and secondary instance or offload your automated tests to the Geo secondary node.
