              The best tools are intuitive. Simply working as expected. But no tool is perfect. There
              will be a time when you'll need to troubleshoot. Premium Support gives your team a single point of contact for all of your onboarding,
              training, upgrading, and troubleshooting needs.
            %li
              Premium Support is available to GitLab Enterprise Edition customers.
