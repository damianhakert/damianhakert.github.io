            Review Apps transform the way you and your team work. For developers this
            means you can kick off your feedback process much sooner. Submit a merge request
            and preview your changes in a live environment. When you push to master,
            you'll know your changes have gone through CI testing as well as a live review
            where the team can make sure things actually work.

            For designers, product managers, marketing counterparts, etc., giving feedback
            just got a lot easier. You won't have to check out branches or spin up a staging
            environment to preview changes. With Review Apps, you click a link and see the live changes.
            Hopefully, this means you can give more timely and informed feedback.
