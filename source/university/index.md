## What is GitLab University

Version control will be the standard for creation of any type of media in the
future. Today it's still pretty hard to master.

GitLab University has as a goal to teach Git, GitLab and everything that relates
to that to anyone willing to listen and participate.

## Process

### Suggesting improvements

If you would like to teach ca class or participate or help in any way please submit a merge request and assign it to [Job](https://gitlab.com/u/JobV).

If you have suggestions for additional courses you would like to see,
please submit a merge request to add an upcoming class, assign to [Chad](https://gitlab.com/u/chadmalchow) and /cc [Job](https://gitlab.com/u/JobV).

### Adding classes

1. All training materials of any kind should be added to this repository and the /university page to ensure they are available to a broad audidence (don't use any other repo or storage for training materials).
1. Don't make materials that are needlessly specific to one group of people, try to keep the wording broad and inclusive (don't make things for only GitLab Inc. people, only interns, only customers, etc.).
1. To allow people to contribute to them all content should be in git.
1. The content can go in a subdirectory under /university
1. Please link your materials from this page, either under 'Non sales bootcamp classes' or 'Other'
1. To make, view or modify the slides of the classes use [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) or [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), do not use Powerpoint or Google Slides since this prevents everyone from contributing.
1. Please upload any video recordings to our Youtube channel, we prefer them to be public, if needed they can be unlisted but if so they should be linked from this page.
1. Please create a merge request and assign to [Job](https://gitlab.com/u/JobV).

### Recordings

There is a [YouTube playlist with all recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthbQu_IWlNOxul0TbS_2JH-e).

### Webcasts

For GitLab Inc. team members only there is a university class every Thursday at 5PM UTC, send Job a message to sign up.

### Sales bootcamp week 1 to 3
