## Email and Highrise guidelines

1. Always reply, do not start a new thread

1. Always bcc: Sytse and the highrise dropbox

1. Use ctrl+shift+v to ensure the font is the same

1. Always send from the sales@ address

1. Always reply unless they send a one word email

1. If one company has more deals, assign email to specific deal

1. All emails can be seen in the company page

1. Keep all notes & status info in Highrise (including call preparation), no editors or sheets

## Follow-up on incoming sales e-mails

1. Reply to emails as the first thing of the day and don't do anything else before all emails are answered

1. Prioritize emails from larger (potential) customers that can quickly be answering if the answering  takes more than a few hours

1. All emails should be answered in 24 hours after they are received.

1. If Marc is overloaded and can't reply in 24 hours he will inform Sytse by email

1. In case any other team member receives a sales/commercial e-mail that is not addressed to the sales@gitlab.com address, they should forward it to Highrise and create a Highrise task assigned to Marc

## Follow-up on customers

1. See Incoming orders for setting the highrise task

1. Follow-up on customers is done by Marc

1. Follow-up on orders of more than $1000,-: 2 to 4 week after paying

1. Follow-up is not needed immediately after customer pays, because Recurly automatically sends an email with relevant information

## Prioritizing responses

1. Estimate by size of company * percentage developers * $20 per year

1. Bigger deals: always reach out to other people

1. Biggest deals: reach out to a third person or more

1. Respond to incoming big leads in the same day

1. Lead is big if: important name or many users
