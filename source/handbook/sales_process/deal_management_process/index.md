## Handover from sales to support for future support calls

1. Support call is offered in a sales call

1. Sales either bcc’s support@ gitlab.com or send separate email to support@ gitlab.com to inform on the future support call

## User count

Good advice to give to customers for performing the user count:

- /admin/users

- count active users

The above is a good estimate, because it lists only users that are not blocked, even if they last logged in more than 30 days ago.

## Managing potential customer technical questions

GitLab is so affordable because we make very good use of our HR. Therefore, we try our best to address customer questions via channels other than on-site meetings.
[The GitLab Remote Manifesto](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/)

1. Sales gets a list of technical questions from the potential customer (either via email, or via a call)

1. Sales attempts to answer as many questions as possible by using the online resources available (especially doc.gitlab.com)

1. For any questions that sales cannot answer, they reach out to the appropriate person in the company, and then documents their answer

1. If some corner cases or a complex discussion, then sales brokers a call with a service engineer

1. On-site meetings with service engineers only an option if neither email conversation, nor phone/video calls answered the questions

## Custom agreements

[The GitLab Terms](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/) are the standard. In cases where sales considers it’s warranted, we can accept custom agreements. All custom agreements should contain the text: "If there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any text on the GitLab quote or the GitLab invoice, the terms of this Agreement prevail over those in either the quote or the invoice."

## Pricing and discounts

1. We do not offer reseller pricing. We accept resellers buying in the name of another company

1. We do not offer tiered pricing (i.e. discount per larger volumes)

1. Current prices are listed in the [sales sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1755SblMccalWXSahspOrfzBwjGp4F8TkwlB8dOXCGlU/edit#gid=11); if the prices change, they need to be amended there as well

Case study and prepayment discounts are detailed in the [sales sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1755SblMccalWXSahspOrfzBwjGp4F8TkwlB8dOXCGlU/edit#gid=11)

### Volume discounts

1. Only if the customer insists and would likely go for a basic subscription instead

1. Only for 100+ users and the full amount of eventual users

1. 50% discount for buying the full license early

1. Only on standard and plus subscriptions

1. Always contain a minimum amount of users

1. Always contain a deadline (end of next month)

1. Never contain a price per user

1. Prepay discounts do still apply

1. Valid for the first year, prepay to get for multiple years

### Pay later subscription model

This model is an alternative to the yearly payment model

1. The year is split in equal time-slots (e.g. twice a year, quarterly, etc) or just yearly

1. At the start, the customer pays the full subscription for the current number of users

1. There is no further purchase until the end of the first time-slot

1. At the beginning of the new time-slot, the customer counts the users

1. Customer purchases any new subscription packs for the upcoming period

1. Customer pays 50% of the new subscription packs retroactively

### True-up subscription model

1. At least for 3 years

1. Only for +1000 users

1. We agree on a minimum number of users with the customer

1. The customer can add as many users as they desire without paying extra

1. At renewal time, customer purchases additional subscriptions, and they also pay for the minimum number previously agreed

## Cancelling a subscription for a Recurly customer

Trigger: customer with a valid subscription requests a cancellation either via support or via sales

1. Sales asks why cancellation is requested and mentions that the customer will not be compliant to use the Enterprise Edition without a subscription

1. If possible, sales tries to address the reasons why cancellation is requested
