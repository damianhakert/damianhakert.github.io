## How is a license created?

[Reference](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/license-app/merge_requests/6)

1. License-app

1. Sales pulls [subscription id](https://license.gitlab.com/subscriptions) from Recurly and presses awesome green button 

1. If customer did not receive [license email](https://license.gitlab.com/licenses), choose customer, and re-send email

## EE access

All access to the Enterprise Edition is offered only along with the [terms](https://about.gitlab.com/terms/), either with a subscription, or an evaluation.

## Evaluation/Trial access rules

1. Small opportunity (small organization and less than 1 standard pack/10 basic packs): Trial is not available. [Send template email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xholewfn3PrzdRIFrxCE-0hQdQdryXuBnlUYGmm76iA/edit#heading=h.t1uw2df6jz6e)

1. Large opportunity (large organization or more than 1 standard pack/10 basic packs): 45 day trials are available and can be extended if needed. Prospect should sign the [Evaluation Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YvYWlou1OUsQTEhwYZzj8WXPv9bwPhlcVnLI2euA7EQ/edit?usp=sharing). Print Google Doc as PDF and send to prospect. Signed copies should be saved in Drive with file name as exampleco_eval_agreement_signed032615. End of trial is listed in “Renewal date” of the sales sheet. Sales follows-up until a firm response (yes/no). If answer is no, then access is removed, and customer is informed to remove GitLab Enterprise Edition from their server
