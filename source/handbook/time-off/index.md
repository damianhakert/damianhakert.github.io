## Policy for Exempt Employees of GitLab Inc. <a name="pto-exempt"></a>
At GitLab, we believe that taking time off for vacation and other personal needs is essential to the health and productivity of every employee.   
As always, GitLab wants to ensure that its employees enjoy a reasonable amount of time off, and toward that end, employees covered by this Policy 
are encouraged to work with their supervisors to ensure that they take sufficient time off each year to relax, "recharge", and maintain good health. 
However, exempt U.S. employees are not entitled to any prescribed amount of time off, and they will not be paid for any unused time off upon termination.


This policy document outlines GitLab ’s policy on time off for exempt employees. The Sick Time Off program applies to all regular exempt U.S. employees
working at GitLab Inc. including those working fewer than 20 hours per week.  The other Time Off Program provisions detailed in this document apply to 
exempt U.S. employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week.


GitLab  does not have prescribed vacation days for its U.S. exempt employees.   What does this mean for exempt U.S. employees working at least 20 hours 
per week in terms of taking time off from work? If you wish to take time off from work for purposes of vacation or other personal reasons, you may do so 
with the prior approval of your supervisor, and you will continue to be paid your base salary during the approved time off period. Simply put, exempt 
U.S. employees will be paid their regular base salary at all times while they are actively employed by GitLab  (including while on GitLab  holidays); 
the only time they will not receive their base salary will be during periods when they are on a leave of absence or are taking Sick Time Off, at which 
time they will be subject to the compensation and benefits provisions of the applicable GitLab  leave of absence policy or the Sick Time Off provision 
below.


Approval of an employee’s request for time off will be based on his/her supervisor's review of appropriate business considerations including, without 
limitation, the needs of the employee’s business unit, the employee’s work performance and workload, the employee’s ability to meet his/her work 
commitments and duties, and the amount of time off previously taken by the employee. An employee’s request may be denied or postponed by his/her 
manager based upon the manager’s evaluation of those criteria. Requests for foreseeable time off should be made as far in advance as is reasonably 
possible. When an unexpected need for time off arises, as long as the request is reasonable and can be accommodated under the criteria listed in the 
first sentence of this paragraph, the request will normally be granted by the employee’s manager. Advance notice of the need for such unanticipated time 
off is required whenever possible.
 
### Sick Time Off

Exempt U.S. employees will earn up to 10 days of paid Sick Time Off per calendar year (3.3 hours per pay period from the start of employment) up to a 
maximum accrual balance of 10 days. Once that 10 -day maximum is reached, an employee will stop accruing Sick Time Off until he/she uses some of it and
his/her accrual falls below 10  days; at that point, the employee will begin accruing again at the above rate until the 10 -day “cap” is reached. Sick 
Time Off may be used in hourly increments.


If you are a regular, part-time employee scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week, you will accrue Sick Time Off based on the above rate on a 
pro-rated basis using the percentage of time you work per week (as measured against a 40-hour workweek). Your use of Sick Time will also be on a 
pro-rated basis.

For example:

*  If you work 32 hours per week, you would accrue Sick Time at 80% of the rates in the above table (32/40 = 0.80)
*  If you use a week of Sick Time, you will be paid your normal weekly part-time pay (32 hours of Sick Time Off)

You can use Sick time for any of the following purposes:

*  When you are sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
*  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition for yourself.
*  When your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, grandchild, sibling, is sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
*  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, 
grandchild, sibling.
*  To take care of practical, legal, or safety needs related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
*  For needs related to the closure of your place of business or your child’s school if either has been closed to limit exposure to hazardous materials.
If an employee has no spouse, family member, or domestic partner, the employee may designate one person for whom the employee wishes to use time off 
to provide aid or care. Unused Sick Time Off will “carry over” from year-to-year subject to the “cap” described above, and it will not be paid out upon 
termination.

### Taking Sick Time
Employees who are taking Sick Time Off must inform their managers of that fact no later than the time they are scheduled to start work that day, unless 
there is an exigent circumstance,in which case the employee must inform his/her manager as soon as possible. If an employee fails to return to work 
following his/her use of Sick Time Off without his/her manager’s approval, his/her employment with GitLab  will terminate for job abandonment. Employees 
who are absent for more than three consecutive days will, upon GitLab 's request, need to provide the Company with a doctor's certificate confirming 
their need for Sick Time Off for themselves, or for the care of another or other appropriate documentation of the need for Sick Time Off for safety 
related purposes as listed above.

Any sick time off taken in excess of an employee’s accrued paid Sick Time Off balance will be unpaid.

If you become ill and are under a doctor’s care and need to take more than five consecutive days of sick time off, you must apply for a medical leave 
of absence. You will use available Sick Time for your first five consecutive business days off from work for each occurrence and thereafter you may be
eligible for short-term disability pay. 

GitLab  reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time and for any reason as determined by GitLab  management in its sole discretion. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy document, employees whose attendance or work performance is unsatisfactory in anyway will be 
subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of their employment with GitLab.
