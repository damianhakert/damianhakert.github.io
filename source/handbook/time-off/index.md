* [Policy for Employees of GitLab BV (Netherlands)](#pto-NL)

At GitLab, we believe that taking time off for vacation and other personal needs is essential to the health and productivity of every employee. 
GitLab wants to ensure that its employees enjoy a reasonable amount of time off, and toward that end, employees covered by this Policy 
are encouraged to work with their supervisors to ensure that they take sufficient time off each year to relax, "recharge", and maintain good health. 
GitLab also recognizes that employees may have different needs, depending on their individual circumstances. 

## Policy for Exempt Employees of GitLab Inc. <a name="pto-exempt"></a>
 
This policy document outlines GitLab ’s policy on time off for exempt employees. The Sick Time Off program applies to all regular exempt employees
working at GitLab Inc. including those working fewer than 20 hours per week.  The other Time Off Program provisions detailed in this document apply to 
exempt employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week.

### Taking Time Off
* When you plan to take time off from work, notify your supervisor. 
* You will continue to be paid your base salary during the time off period. 
* The only time that you will not receive your base salary will be during periods when you are on a leave of absence or are taking Sick Time Off, at which 
time they will be subject to the compensation and benefits provisions of the applicable GitLab leave of absence policy or the Sick Time Off provision 
below. 
* Note that while there is no prescribed amount of time off, this also means that exempt employees are not *entitled* to any prescribed amount of time off, and they will not be paid 
for any unused time off upon termination.

### Sick Time Off

* Exempt employees will earn 3.3 hours of paid Sick Time Off per pay period from the start of employment up to a maximum accrual balance of 10 days per calendar year.
* Once that 10-day maximum is reached, an employee will stop accruing Sick Time Off until he/she uses some of it and
his/her accrual falls below 10  days.
* Sick Time Off may be used in hourly increments.
* If you are a regular, part-time employee scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week, you will accrue Sick Time Off based on the above rate on a 
pro-rated basis using the percentage of time you work per week (as measured against a 40-hour workweek). Your use of Sick Time will also be on a 
pro-rated basis. For example:  
   *  If you work 32 hours per week, you would accrue Sick Time at 80% of the rates in the above table (32/40 = 0.80) 
   *  If you use a week of Sick Time, you will be paid your normal weekly part-time pay (32 hours of Sick Time Off) 
* You can use Sick time for any of the following purposes:
   *  When you are sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
   *  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition for yourself.
   *  When your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, grandchild, sibling, is sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
   *  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, 
grandchild, sibling.
   *  To take care of practical, legal, or safety needs related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
   *  For needs related to the closure of your place of business or your child’s school if either has been closed to limit exposure to hazardous materials.
   *  If an employee has no spouse, family member, or domestic partner, the employee may designate one person for whom the employee wishes to use time off 
to provide aid or care. Unused Sick Time Off will “carry over” from year-to-year subject to the “cap” described above, and it will not be paid out upon 
termination.

#### Taking Sick Time
* Employees who are taking Sick Time Off must inform their managers of that fact as soon as possible (before the scheduled start of the work day if possible).
* If an employee fails to return to work following his/her use of Sick Time Off without his/her manager’s approval, his/her employment with GitLab may be 
terminate for job abandonment. 
* Employees who are absent for more than three consecutive days will, upon GitLab 's request, need to provide the Company with a doctor's certificate 
confirming their need for Sick Time Off for themselves, or for the care of another or other appropriate documentation of the need for Sick Time Off for 
safety related purposes as listed above.
* Any sick time off taken in excess of an employee’s accrued paid Sick Time Off balance will be unpaid.
* If you become ill and are under a doctor’s care and need to take more than five consecutive days of sick time off, you must apply for a medical leave 
of absence. You will use available Sick Time for your first five consecutive business days off from work for each occurrence and thereafter you may be
eligible for short-term disability pay. 

### Modifications
GitLab reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time and for any reason as determined by GitLab  management in its sole discretion. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy document, employees whose attendance or work performance is unsatisfactory in anyway will be 
subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of their employment with GitLab.



## Policy for Non-Exempt Employees of GitLab Inc. <a name="pto-nonexempt"></a>

This policy document outlines GitLab’s policy on time off for U.S. non-exempt employees. It applies to all regular non-exempt U.S. employees working 
at GitLab, Inc.
 
### How Personal Time Off (PTO) Works

* You begin to accrue PTO with your first full pay period of active work at GitLab. 
* The amount of PTO you earn per month is 8 hours per pay period based on a standard 40-hour week.
* The maximum amount of PTO you can accrue at any time is 240 hours (30 days).
* Accrued PTO can be carried over from one year to the next (but still subject to the maximum accrual of 240 hours).
* If you are a non-exempt, part-time employee scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week, you will accrue PTO based on a pro-rated basis using the 
percentage of time you work per week (as measured against a 40-hour workweek). Your use of PTO will also be on a pro-rated basis. For example:
   * If you work 32 hours per week, you would accrue PTO at 80% of 8 hours or 6.4 hours (32 ÷ 40 = 0.80 x 8 = 6.4) per week
   * If you use a week of PTO, you will be paid your normal weekly part-time pay (32 hours of PTO)
* Notify your manager of when you want to use your PTO. 
* At certain times, the Company may require you to use PTO. PTO is paid out at the employee’s 
base pay rate, and does not include commissions, overtime pay, bonuses, or other base pay supplements.
* You can use PTO for any of the following purposes:
   * For vacation.
   * When you are sick, injured or receiving medical care or treatment
   * To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition for yourself.
   * To care for a sick, injured child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, grandchild, or sibling, or when such an individual is
receiving medical care or treatment.
   * To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, 
grandchild, sibling.
   * For an extended bereavement time off.
   * To take care of personal business.
   * To take care of practical, legal, or safety needs related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
   * To celebrate a holiday GitLab does not officially observe.
   * To take time for a child’s school-related activities, including parent-teacher conferences.
   * For needs related to the closure of your place of business or your child’s school if either has been closed to limit exposure to hazardous materials.
* If your employment with GitLab ends for any reason, you will be paid for all accrued but unused PTO. Similarly, if you have a negative PTO balance 
(you used more PTO than you accrued), you must repay the negative balance upon your termination (to the extent allowed by local law, GitLab may elect 
to deduct that amount from your final paycheck).
* In addition to PTO, all non-exempt U.S. employees working at least 24 hours per week will be paid their regular daily base pay on all Company 
holidays. GitLab typically has 12 holidays per year. The holiday schedule can be found in the Employee Handbook.
* If you are a non-exempt employee who has to work on a Company-designated holiday, you will receive time and- a-half pay for the hours actually worked
on the holiday, in addition to your regular pay for the holiday. For example, if you are a full-time, non-exempt employee and you work eight hours on 
a holiday, you will receive 2.5 times your normal daily rate of pay (regular pay plus 1.5 times holiday pay).


#### Taking PTO When You Are Sick
* Employees who are sick must inform their managers of that fact as soon as possible (before the scheduled start of the work day if possible).
* Employees who are absent for more than three consecutive days will, upon GitLab 's request, need to provide the Company with a doctor's certificate 
confirming their need for Sick Time Off for themselves, or for the care of another or other appropriate documentation of the need for Sick Time Off for 
safety related purposes as listed above.
* As a non-exempt employee, you must report PTO hours to payroll with a copy to your manager. You may take PTO in hourly increments.
* If you become ill and are under a doctor’s care and need to take more than five consecutive days of sick time off, you must apply for a medical leave 
of absence. You will use available Sick Time for your first five consecutive business days off from work for each occurrence and thereafter you may be
eligible for short-term disability pay.  

 
### Modifications
