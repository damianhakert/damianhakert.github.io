* [Policy for Employees of GitLab BV (Netherlands)](#pto-NL)

At GitLab, we believe that taking time off for vacation and other personal needs is essential to the health and productivity of every employee. 
GitLab wants to ensure that its employees enjoy a reasonable amount of time off, and toward that end, employees covered by this Policy 
are encouraged to work with their supervisors to ensure that they take sufficient time off each year to relax, "recharge", and maintain good health. 
GitLab also recognizes that employees may have different needs, depending on their individual circumstances.

## Policy for Exempt Employees of GitLab Inc. <a name="pto-exempt"></a>
 
This policy document outlines GitLab ’s policy on time off for exempt U.S. employees. The Sick Time Off program applies to all regular exempt U.S. employees
working at GitLab Inc. including those working fewer than 20 hours per week.  The other Time Off Program provisions detailed in this document apply to 
exempt U.S. employees who are regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week.

### No Prescribed Amount of Time Off
GitLab  does not have prescribed vacation days for its U.S. exempt employees.   What does this mean for exempt U.S. employees working at least 20 hours 
per week in terms of taking time off from work? 

If you wish to take time off from work for purposes of vacation or other personal reasons, you may do so 
with the prior approval of your supervisor, and you will continue to be paid your base salary during the approved time off period. Simply put, exempt 
U.S. employees will be paid their regular base salary at all times while they are actively employed by GitLab  (including while on GitLab  holidays); 
the only time they will not receive their base salary will be during periods when they are on a leave of absence or are taking Sick Time Off, at which 
time they will be subject to the compensation and benefits provisions of the applicable GitLab  leave of absence policy or the Sick Time Off provision 
below. No prescribed time off also means that exempt U.S. employees are not *entitled* to any prescribed amount of time off, and they will not be paid 
for any unused time off upon termination.

### Approval for Time Off
Approval of an employee’s request for time off will be based on his/her supervisor's review of appropriate business considerations including, without 
limitation, the needs of the employee’s business unit, the employee’s work performance and workload, the employee’s ability to meet his/her work 
commitments and duties, and the amount of time off previously taken by the employee. An employee’s request may be denied or postponed by his/her 
manager based upon the manager’s evaluation of those criteria. Requests for foreseeable time off should be made as far in advance as is reasonably 
possible. When an unexpected need for time off arises, as long as the request is reasonable and can be accommodated under the criteria listed in the 
first sentence of this paragraph, the request will normally be granted by the employee’s manager. Advance notice of the need for such unanticipated time 
off is required whenever possible.
 
### Sick Time Off

Exempt U.S. employees will earn up to 10 days of paid Sick Time Off per calendar year (3.3 hours per pay period from the start of employment) up to a 
maximum accrual balance of 10 days. Once that 10 -day maximum is reached, an employee will stop accruing Sick Time Off until he/she uses some of it and
his/her accrual falls below 10  days; at that point, the employee will begin accruing again at the above rate until the 10 -day “cap” is reached. Sick 
Time Off may be used in hourly increments.


If you are a regular, part-time employee scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week, you will accrue Sick Time Off based on the above rate on a 
pro-rated basis using the percentage of time you work per week (as measured against a 40-hour workweek). Your use of Sick Time will also be on a 
pro-rated basis.

For example:  

*  If you work 32 hours per week, you would accrue Sick Time at 80% of the rates in the above table (32/40 = 0.80)
*  If you use a week of Sick Time, you will be paid your normal weekly part-time pay (32 hours of Sick Time Off)

You can use Sick time for any of the following purposes:

*  When you are sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
*  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition for yourself.
*  When your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, grandchild, sibling, is sick, injured, or receiving medical care or treatment.
*  To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, 
grandchild, sibling.
*  To take care of practical, legal, or safety needs related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
*  For needs related to the closure of your place of business or your child’s school if either has been closed to limit exposure to hazardous materials.
If an employee has no spouse, family member, or domestic partner, the employee may designate one person for whom the employee wishes to use time off 
to provide aid or care. Unused Sick Time Off will “carry over” from year-to-year subject to the “cap” described above, and it will not be paid out upon 
termination.

### Taking Sick Time
Employees who are taking Sick Time Off must inform their managers of that fact no later than the time they are scheduled to start work that day, unless 
there is an exigent circumstance,in which case the employee must inform his/her manager as soon as possible. If an employee fails to return to work 
following his/her use of Sick Time Off without his/her manager’s approval, his/her employment with GitLab  will terminate for job abandonment. Employees 
who are absent for more than three consecutive days will, upon GitLab 's request, need to provide the Company with a doctor's certificate confirming 
their need for Sick Time Off for themselves, or for the care of another or other appropriate documentation of the need for Sick Time Off for safety 
related purposes as listed above.

Any sick time off taken in excess of an employee’s accrued paid Sick Time Off balance will be unpaid.

If you become ill and are under a doctor’s care and need to take more than five consecutive days of sick time off, you must apply for a medical leave 
of absence. You will use available Sick Time for your first five consecutive business days off from work for each occurrence and thereafter you may be
eligible for short-term disability pay. 

### Modifications
GitLab  reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time and for any reason as determined by GitLab  management in its sole discretion. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy document, employees whose attendance or work performance is unsatisfactory in anyway will be 
subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of their employment with GitLab.



## Policy for Non-Exempt Employees of GitLab Inc. <a name="pto-nonexempt"></a>

This policy document outlines GitLab’s policy on time off for U.S. non-exempt employees. It applies to all regular non-exempt U.S. employees working 
at GitLab, Inc.
 
### Personal Time Off
 
GitLab’s Personal Time Off (PTO) Program allows you to take time away from work for a variety of reasons. You can use PTO to take a vacation, take 
time off when you are sick, attend to a personal matter, care for a sick family member, recover from an illness, celebrate a holiday not otherwise 
observed by the Company… it’s up to you!
 
### How PTO Works
 
You will earn a certain number of hours of PTO each month according to the number of hours you are regularly scheduled to work per week (up to a 
maximum of 40 hours).  The maximum amount of PTO you can accrue at any time is 240 hours (30 days). Subject to the approval of your manager, you 
generally choose how and when you want to use your PTO. At certain times, the Company may require you to use PTO. PTO is paid out at the employee’s 
base pay rate, and does not include commissions, overtime pay, bonuses, or other base pay supplements.
 
You can use PTO for any of the following purposes:
 
* For vacation.
* When you are sick, injured or receiving medical care or treatment
* To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition for yourself.
* To care for a sick, injured child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, grandchild, or sibling, or when such an individual is
receiving medical care or treatment.
* To attend to preventive care or care of an existing health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, in-law, or grandparent, 
grandchild, sibling.
* For an extended bereavement time off.
* To take care of personal business.
* To take care of practical, legal, or safety needs related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
* To celebrate a holiday GitLab does not officially observe.
* To take time for a child’s school-related activities, including parent-teacher conferences.
* For needs related to the closure of your place of business or your child’s school if either has been closed to limit exposure to hazardous materials.
 
### Accruing PTO
 
You begin to accrue PTO with your first full pay period of active work at GitLab. The amount of PTO you earn per month is 8 hours per pay period 
based on a standard 40-hour week.
 
If you are a regular, part-time employee scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week, you will accrue PTO based on a pro-rated basis using the 
percentage of time you work per week (as measured against a 40-hour workweek). Your use of PTO will also be on a pro-rated basis.
 
For example:
 
* If you work 32 hours per week, you would accrue PTO at 80% of 8 hours or 6.4 hours (32 ÷ 40 = 0.80 x 8 = 6.4)
* If you use a week of PTO, you will be paid your normal weekly part-time pay (32 hours of PTO)
 
### Scheduling PTO
 
When scheduling PTO, particularly for vacation purposes, please give your manager as much notice as possible. GitLab will make every reasonable 
effort to accommodate your request, but all planned PTO is subject to manager approval. This means your requested time off may be postponed if your 
manager deems it necessary due to the needs of the business.
 
When you are sick, you must call your manager no later than the time you are regularly scheduled to start work each day. Employees who are absent 
for more than three consecutive days will, upon GitLab's request, need to provide the Company with a doctor's certificate confirming their need for 
sick time off for themselves or for the care of another or other appropriate documentation of the need for time off for safely related purposes as 
listed above. As a non-exempt employee, you must report PTO hours to payroll with a copy to your manager. You may take PTO in hourly increments.
 
### Taking PTO When You Are Ill
 
If you become ill and are under a doctor’s care and need to take more than five consecutive days of sick time off, you must apply for a medical 
leave of absence. You will use available PTO for your first five consecutive business days off from work for each occurrence and thereafter receive 
pay pursuant to the Company’s Short Term Disability policy.
 
### PTO Carryover and Maximum Accrual
 
GitLab believes that rest and time away from your job are important. In order to encourage employees to use the PTO program for that purpose, the 
program includes a cap on the amount of PTO that you can accrue. While you may carry over accrued PTO from one year to the next, the maximum amount 
of PTO you can accrue at any time is 240 hours (30 days). Once you reach that maximum, you will not accrue any additional PTO until you reduce your 
PTO balance below the maximum.
 
### Leaving GitLab
 
If your employment with GitLab ends for any reason, you will be paid for all accrued but unused PTO. Similarly, if you have a negative PTO balance 
(you used more PTO than you accrued), you must repay the negative balance upon your termination (to the extent allowed by local law, GitLab may elect 
to deduct that amount from your final paycheck). You cannot extend your last day at GitLab by the amount of PTO you have remaining.
 
### Holidays
 
In addition to PTO, all non-exempt U.S. employees working at least 24 hours per week will be paid their regular daily base pay on all Company holidays. 
GitLab typically has 12 holidays per year. The holiday schedule can be found in the Employee Handbook.
 
If you are a non-exempt employee who has to work on a Company-designated holiday, you will receive time and- a-half pay for the hours actually worked
on the holiday, in addition to your regular pay for the holiday. For example, if you are a full-time, non-exempt employee and you work eight hours on 
a holiday, you will receive 2.5 times your normal daily rate of pay (regular pay plus 1.5 times holiday pay).
 
### Modifications
 
GitLab reserves the right to modify this Time Off Program for non-exempt U.S. employees at any time and for any reason as determined by GitLab 
management in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding anything contained in this policy document, employees whose attendance or work performance is 
unsatisfactory in any way will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of their employment with GitLab.
