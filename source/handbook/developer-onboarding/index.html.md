Awesome! You're about to become a GitLab developer!
Make sure you've checked out our [handbook] beforehand, so you get a feeling
of how we work at GitLab. Below you'll find everything you need to start developing.
If something is missing, add it (as goes with everything at GitLab)!

## GitLab Instances

We have two main GitLab instances, as explained in the
[general onboarding](/handbook/general-onboarding#gitlab-instances).

## Getting started with GitLab development

To start development, follow the instructions for the
[GitLab Development Kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit).

## GitLab Repositories

Almost all repositories are available on both gitlab.com and dev.gitlab.org. We
also mirror our biggest projects to [GitHub](https://github.com/gitlabhq),
making them more widely available for people to contribute.

### GitLab Community Edition (CE)

This is the community edition of GitLab. Most of the development happens here,
then gets merged into GitLab EE periodically. Unless you're making a change
specific to GitLab EE, add it to CE.

- [https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq)
- [https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq)

### GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)

This is _not_ an open source project, but we made the source code available for
viewing and contributions. As of version 7.11, it requires a license key to be
used. To be able to run your own instances for development you can use one of
the shared licenses (like <https://license.gitlab.com/licenses/1449>) or you
can clone <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/license-app> and generate your own
licenses.

### GitLab Shell

GitLab Shell handles Git commands for GitLab. It's an essential part of GitLab.

- [https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-shell](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-shell)
- [https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-shell](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-shell)

### GitLab Workhorse

Gitlab-workhorse is a smart reverse proxy for GitLab. It handles "large" HTTP
requests such as file downloads, file uploads, Git push/pull and Git archive
downloads.

### Omnibus GitLab

Omnibus GitLab creates the packages for GitLab.

- [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab)
- [https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab)
- [https://github.com/gitlabhq/omnibus-gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/omnibus-gitlab)

## Cloud infrastructure

GitLab.com runs on Microsoft Azure. Many people in GitLab also have instances
on DigitalOcean. If you need a VPS for any reason, it's probably easiest
to set one up at DigitalOcean. Ask another developer for access.

## Infrastructure

For everything related to infrastructure, check out the
[Infrastructure handbook](/handbook/infrastructure).

## Basics of GitLab development

### Workflow

Please see the [engineering workflow document][eng-wf] in the handbook.

[eng-wf]: /handbook/engineering/workflow

### Quality

One of GitLab's strengths is its high quality of software. To achieve this we've
introduced some requirements to all source code that is contributed. All
requirements are mentioned in [the Contribution guide][contrib-guide].
Make sure you read and follow it.

### Dependencies

GitLab can be installed through an Omnibus package or from source on different
Linux distributions and macOS. In order to maintain portability, we need to
avoid adding extra dependencies and use of exotic database extensions. Every
time you choose between changes in the application code or adding new
dependencies, you should give priority to the first because this is easier to
maintain and setup. If you still need to bring new dependencies to GitLab, ask
another developer or the CTO for advice.

### Submit your code

In GitLab all code should go through a review process before it can be merged.
Make sure you submit a merge request for any changes you've made.
When the merge request is ready, it should be assigned to someone else on the team.
This person is then responsible for reviewing your code and merging it.
Optionally, you can request another developer to help or review by writing a comment.
If a merge request is not assigned, it will probably be ignored and create
unnecessary delays.

Don't work on one task for multiple days before submitting a merge request.
Even the biggest task can be split into smaller tasks.
Try to submit a merge request for each part of the functionality.
This means that we expect multiple merge requests per week from you.
Smaller merge requests are more likely to receive good feedback and will get
merged sooner.

Unless the change is very minor, or is fixing a bug that was introduced in the
same version, add an entry to `CHANGELOG` (or `CHANGELOG-EE` when applicable).
Do not include your name in the entry as we only do that to give recognition to
volunteer contributors.

### Ruby Gems

When building and publishing Gems for GitLab make sure multiple developers have
access to said Gem on RubyGems.org. This ensures a Gem doesn't end up being
orphaned because the original author left, lost their credentials, passed away,
etc. When publishing a Gem you can add some or all of the following people as
co-owners:

* [Dmitriy Zaporozhets](https://rubygems.org/profiles/randx)
* [Douwe Maan](https://rubygems.org/profiles/DouweM)
* [Marin Jankovski](https://rubygems.org/profiles/marinjankovski)
* [RÃ©my Coutable](https://rubygems.org/profiles/rymai)
* [Robert Speicher](https://rubygems.org/profiles/rspeicher)
* [Stan Hu](https://rubygems.org/profiles/stanhu)
* [Yorick Peterse](https://rubygems.org/profiles/YorickPeterse)

You're of course free to add other developers as well.
