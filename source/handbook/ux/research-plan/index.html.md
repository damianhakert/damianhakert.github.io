### Completed

**Persona Discovery Survey | Jan 2017**    
Based on 550+ responses from our users, 3 dinstinct personas emerged. [See the details](/handbook/ux/personas). [Read about the process](https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/09/the-importance-of-ux-personas/)

**Quick IDE font size survey | Jan 2017**     
Quickly surveyed GitLab engineers to see what font sizes were preferred for IDEs. From this, we learned a slight decrease in font size would enable people to review larger merge requests easier. [Fixed here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/8157)

**Issue filter bar user research | Jan 2017**    
Conducted user testing on the micro-interaction details of the new Issue Filter bar. Isolated the important UX details needed to polish the experience. [Related research issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/26945)
