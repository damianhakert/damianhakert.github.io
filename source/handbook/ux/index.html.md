The UX Team is responsible for the design and user experience of GitLab.

## UX Designer Workflow
1. Work on issues tagged with 'UX' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux). Prioritize issues scheduled for the current milestone.
2. Once UX work is completed and feedback addressed, unassign yourself and remove the UX label. Add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) needed for the issue. Typically, this is the Frontend label.
3. Continue to follow the issue, addressing any additional UX issues that come up.
