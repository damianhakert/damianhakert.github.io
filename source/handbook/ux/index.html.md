The UX Team is responsible for the design and user experience of GitLab.

## UX Designer Workflow

Issues should be tagged with 'UX' if UX work is required.

1. Work on issues tagged with 'UX' on [CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux) and [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?label_name=ux). Prioritize issues scheduled for the current milestone. If all the issues for the current milestone have been addressed, seek out issues tagged 'coming soon'.
1. Once UX work is completed and feedback addressed, unassign yourself and remove the UX label. Add the next [workflow label](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/PROCESS.md#workflow-labels) needed for the issue. Typically, this is the Frontend label.
1. Continue to follow the issue, addressing any additional UX issues that come up.
