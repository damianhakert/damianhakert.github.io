## UX Strategy

### 2017 Strategy

#### 1. Navigation is a strength for the GitLab experience [Q1]
* The information architecture is well organized and logical 
* The navigation UX is consolidated, with clear visual hieararchy. It doesn't feel like you have to look all around the experience to find the different ways to navigate
* The visual details of the navigation feel intentional and polished, adapting well to responsive screen sizes, and respecting limited screen realestate.

#### 2. Visually polished and consistent [Q1]
* Consistency across controls (buttons, labels, links, etc.)
* Visual information hierarchy is clean
* Padding and alignment all feels great
* Typography feels polished. (Consider MD styles)

#### 3. Uniquely GitLab [Q2]
* When you look at any screen, you should know immediately that it is GitLab
* Our personality is strong and consistent across product and marketing experiences.

#### 4. New users are supported and guided to become experts in no time [Q2]
* Powerful functionality is ridiculously easy to set up and use (improving tools such as gitlab-ci.yml)
* Errors are easy and clear, allowing me to learn and quickly fix problems
* The possible options and settings for a given feature/experience is clear without having to hunt through all of the settings pages.
