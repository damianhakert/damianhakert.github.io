## Bootcamp Checklist for Training of New Service Engineers
<a name="checklist"></a>

An issue will be created for you with the following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook because it is formatted to be copy-pasted.
The topics are generally ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled,
but feel free to work on later things in the list when you are waiting on something.

```
## Service Engineer Boot Camp

We need to keep iterating on this checklist so please submit MR's for any improvements
that you can think of.

If an item does not start with a role or name of someone else, it's yours to do.

**Goal of this entire checklist:** Set a clear path for Service Engineer training

### Stage 0 (GitLab Inc. only)

#### Goals

- Have all the needed user accounts and permissions for a GitLab Inc. SE

This should have been created for you as an issue by PeopleOps when you were hired

1. [ ] General Onboarding Checklist

  1. [ ] Finish every item on that list starting with `New team member:`
    until you are waiting for someone to answer a question or do something before
    you can continue that list.

    1. [ ] Start with Stage 1 here

    1. [ ] Check back daily on what was blocking you on your General Onboarding Checklist
    until that list is completely done, then focus on this one.

### Stage 1. Git and GitLab basics.

#### Goals

- Aim to have a good overview of the Product and main features, Git and the Company

If you are already comfortable with using Git and GitLab and you will be able to
retain a good amount of information by just reading and watching through, that is
okay. But if you see a topic that is completely new to you, stop the video and try
it out for yourself before continuing.

1. [ ] Just quickly check on your Zendesk account to make sure that is ready for you when you need it.
1. [ ] Let your manager know if for some reason you were not able to create an account on Zendesk.
1. [ ] Under your profile on Zendesk, it should read `Agent`. If it reads `Light Agent`, inform your manager.

Cover these topics on the [GitLab University](https://university.gitlab.com/):

1. [ ] Under the topic of Git

  1. [ ] [About Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16sX7hUrCZyOFbpvnrAFrg6tVO5_yT98IgdAqOmXwBho/edit#slide=id.gd69537a19_0_14)

  1. [ ] [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/account/courses/try-git)

1. [ ] Under the topic of GitLab Basics

  1. [ ] All the [GitLab Basics](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/README.html) that you don't feel comfortable with. If you get stuck, see the linked videos under GLB in GitLab University

  1. [ ] [GitLab Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGotqAUACZA)

  1. [ ] Take a look at how the different GitLab versions [compare](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#compare)

1. [ ] Any of these that you don't feel comfortable with in the [user training](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/University/tree/master/training) we use for our customers.

  1. [ ] `env_setup.md`

  1. [ ] `feature_branching.md`

  1. [ ] `explore_gitlab.md`

  1. [ ] `stash.md`

  1. [ ] `git_log.md`

  1. [ ] For the rest of the topics in `user training`, just do a quick read over the file names so you start remembering where to find them.

### Stage 2. Installation and Administration basics.

1. [ ] Check back on your Zendesk account if you are not yet an `Agent`.
1. [ ] Check to make sure you were added to the `GitLab Support` Google Calendar and can see it's events.

#### Goals

- Get your development machine set up.
- Familiarize yourself with the codebase
- Be prepared to reproduce issues that our users encounter.
- Be comfortable with the different installation options of GitLab
  and configure LDAP.
- Have an installation available for reproducing customer bug reports.

#### Set up your development machine

1. [ ] Install the [GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit)
1. [ ] Add [OpenLDAP](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/tree/master/gitlab-openldap) to your GDK installation.

#### Installations

You will keep one installation continually updated on Digital Ocean, just like many of our clients. But you need to choose where you would like to test other installations.
### We need to list some benefits of each choice here.
1. [ ] Choose your preferred test environment between Local VM's or Digital Ocean and put in in a comment below.

Installation from source is not common but will give you a greater understanding of the components that we employ and how everything fits together.

1. [ ] Perform each of the following [Installation Methods](/installation/) on your preferred test environment you chose above:
  1. [ ] Install via [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/)
  1. [ ] Populate with some test data: User account, Project, Issue
  1. [ ] Backup using our [Backup rake task](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#create-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system)
  1. [ ] Install via [Docker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/docker)
  1. [ ] Restore backup to your Docker VM using our [Restore rake task](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-a-previously-created-backup)
  1. [ ] Version 7 from [Source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/7-14-stable/doc/install/installation.md)

1. [ ] As a part of your general onboarding checklist, you should have asked for
  a Digital Ocean droplet to be created for you, where you can install and
  maintain your own instance of GitLab

  1. [ ] Install via [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/)

  1. [ ] Populate with some test data
    1. [ ] Populated Repos
    1. [ ] Users
    1. [ ] Groups
    1. [ ] Projects
    1. [ ] You can check this box but this one never stops as long as you are a Service Engineer for GitLab. Keep this installation up-to-date as patch and version releases become available, just like our customers would.

1. [ ] Ask as many questions as you can think of on the `#support` chat channel

### Stage 3. Customer Interaction through Zendesk

### Stage 4. Customer Calls

- Gain experience in scheduling and participating in calls with customers

Look at the `GitLab Support` Google Calendar to find customer calls you can listen in on. Contact the person leading the call to check if it is okay for you to jump in on the call, and if they could stay on with you for a few minutes after the call, for you to ask them a few questions about things you didn't understand, and them to ask you a few questions to make sure you understood the items they want you to take away.

1. [ ] Start arranging to pair on calls with other Service Engineers. Aim to cover two of each type of call

1. [ ] Read over the [public run-books to understand common tasks](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks)
1. [ ] Create an issue on the internal Organization tracker to schedule time with the DevOps / Production team, so that you learn how to handle GitLab.com going down. Once you are trained for this, you are ready to be added to the on-call rotation.

### Stage 7. Optional Advanced GitLab Topics
Discuss with your training manager if you should stop here and close your issue
or continue. Also discuss which of the advanced topics should be followed. Do
not just do all of them as they might not be relevant to what customers need
right now and can be a significant time investment.

These are some of GitLab's more advanced features. You can make use of
GitLab.com to understand the features from an end-user perspective and then use
your own instance to understand setup and configuration of the feature from an
Administrative perspective
