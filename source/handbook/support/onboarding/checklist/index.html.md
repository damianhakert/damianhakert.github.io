## Bootcamp Checklist for Training of New Service Engineers
<a name="checklist"></a>

Your hiring manager should create an issue with this checklist on the [support team issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues/) for you as part of your onboarding.
This list looks strange in this handbook because it is formatted to be copy-pasted into an issue and then render properly there.

The topics are generally ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled,
but feel free to work on later things in the list when you are waiting on something.

```
We need to keep iterating on this checklist so please submit MR's for any improvements
that you can think of. If an item does not start with a role or name of someone else, it's yours to do.

**Goal of this entire checklist:** Set a clear path for Service Engineer training

### Stage 0: Complete general onboarding to have all necessary accounts and permissions

- [ ] **Done with Stage 0**

_Typically completed within first week_

1. [ ] General expectations: it is expected that you will _start_ to tackle Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 as early as your first week, but you are not expected to complete all items for some number of weeks. We believe that you often learn best and fastest by diving into (relatively easy) tickets, and learning by doing. However, this has to be balanced with making time to learn some of the tougher topics. The expectation is therefore that you are sufficiently advanced in your onboarding by the end of your first week, that you can answer 2-5 "simple" tickets. Over the following weeks, your manager will set higher targets for the number and difficulty of tickets to be tackled, but you should always have about 2-3 hrs per day to spend on working through this bootcamp. Some days it will be less, some days it will be more, depending on ticket load and how deep "in the zone" you are in either the bootcamp or the tickets you are responding to; but an average of 2-3 hrs per day should allow you to complete everything through to the end of Stage 6 within about four weeks.
1. [ ] General Onboarding Checklist: this should have been created for you on dev.gitlab.org as an issue by PeopleOps when you were hired.
   1. [ ] Finish every item on that list starting with `New team member:` until you are waiting for someone to answer a question or do something before you can continue that list.
   1. [ ] Start with Stage 1 here, but also with the first steps in Stage 2 and Stage 3.
   1. [ ] Check back daily on what was blocking you on your General Onboarding Checklist until that list is completely done, then focus on this one.

### Stage 1: Become familiar with git and GitLab basics

- [ ] **Done with Stage 1**

_Typically started in first week, completed by end of second week_

If you are already comfortable with using Git and GitLab and you will be able to
retain a good amount of information by just reading and watching through, that is
okay. But if you see a topic that is completely new to you, stop the video and try
it out for yourself before continuing.

1. [ ] Just quickly check on your Zendesk account to make sure that is ready for you when you need it.
1. [ ] Add a [profile picture](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690996-Updating-your-user-profile-and-password#topic_rgk_2z2_kh) to your Zendesk account
1. [ ] Let your manager know if for some reason you were not able to create an account on Zendesk.
1. [ ] Under your profile on Zendesk, it should read `Agent`. If it reads `Light Agent`, inform your manager.

Cover these topics on the [GitLab University](https://university.gitlab.com/):

1. [ ] Under the topic of Git
  1. [ ] [About Version Control](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16sX7hUrCZyOFbpvnrAFrg6tVO5_yT98IgdAqOmXwBho/edit#slide=id.gd69537a19_0_14)
  1. [ ] [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/account/courses/try-git)
1. [ ] Under the topic of GitLab Basics
  1. [ ] All the [GitLab Basics](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/README.html) that you don't feel comfortable with. If you get stuck, see the linked videos under GLB in GitLab University
  1. [ ] [GitLab Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGotqAUACZA)
  1. [ ] Take a look at how the different GitLab versions [compare](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#compare)
1. [ ] Any of these that you don't feel comfortable with in the [user training](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/University/tree/master/training) we use for our customers.
  1. [ ] `env_setup.md`
  1. [ ] `feature_branching.md`
  1. [ ] `explore_gitlab.md`
  1. [ ] `stash.md`
  1. [ ] `git_log.md`
  1. [ ] For the rest of the topics in `user training`, just do a quick read over the file names so you start remembering where to find them.
1. [ ] Get familiar with the services GitLab offers
  1. [ ] The differences between [CE and EE](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)
  1. [ ] [GitHost](https://about.gitlab.com/githost-faq/)

### Stage 2. Installation and Administration basics.

- [ ] **Done with Stage 2**

_Typically started in first week, completed by end of third week_

**Goals**

- Get your development machine set up.
- Familiarize yourself with the codebase
- Be prepared to reproduce issues that our users encounter.
- Be comfortable with the different installation options of GitLab
  and configure LDAP.
- Have an installation available for reproducing customer bug reports.

1. [ ] Check back on your Zendesk account if you are not yet an `Agent`.
1. [ ] Hiring Manager: Add team member to to the `GitLab Support` Google Calendar.

**Set up your development machine**

1. [ ] Add [OpenLDAP](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit/tree/master/gitlab-openldap) to your GDK installation.

**Installations**

You will keep one installation continually updated on Digital Ocean, just like many of our clients. But you need to choose where you would like to test other installations. TODO: We need to list some benefits of each choice here.

1. [ ] Choose your preferred test environment between Local VM's or Digital Ocean and put it in a comment below.

Installation from source is not common but will give you a greater understanding of the components that we employ and how everything fits together.

1. [ ] Perform each of the following [Installation Methods](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/) on your preferred test environment you chose above:
  1. [ ] Install via [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/)
  1. [ ] Populate with some test data: User account, Project, Issue
  1. [ ] Backup using our [Backup rake task](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#create-a-backup-of-the-gitlab-system)
  1. [ ] Install via [Docker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master/docker)
  1. [ ] Restore backup to your Docker VM using our [Restore rake task](http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html#restore-a-previously-created-backup)
  1. [ ] Version 7 from [Source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/7-14-stable/doc/install/installation.md)
1. [ ] As a part of your general onboarding checklist, you should have asked for a Digital Ocean droplet to be created for you, where you can install and maintain your own instance of GitLab
  1. [ ] Install via [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/)
  1. [ ] Populate with some test data
    1. [ ] Populated Repos
    1. [ ] Users
    1. [ ] Groups
    1. [ ] Projects
    1. [ ] You can check this box but this one never stops as long as you are a Service Engineer for GitLab. Keep this installation up-to-date as patch and version releases become available, just like our customers would.
1. [ ] Ask as many questions as you can think of on the `#support` chat channel

### Stage 3. Customer Interaction through Zendesk

### Stage 7. Optional Advanced GitLab Topics

Discuss with your training manager if you should stop here and close your issue
or continue. Also discuss which of the advanced topics should be followed. Do
not just do all of them as they might not be relevant to what customers need
right now and can be a significant time investment.

These are some of GitLab's more advanced features. You can make use of
GitLab.com to understand the features from an end-user perspective and then use
your own instance to understand setup and configuration of the feature from an
Administrative perspective
