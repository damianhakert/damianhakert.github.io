## GitHost Administration

### Requesting Access

Ask any of the administrators to give you access to the GitHost UI. Within the UI you will be able to see customer instances, their setup, and their IDs.

You will need to request SSH access to the GitHost production box. For this, please send a chat message to an admin with your Public Key and ask to be added to the authorized_keys of the githost user.

### Documentation
The latest GitHost Administration docs can be found [here](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/GitHost/blob/master/doc/README.md).

### Purchases 

When a customer purchases GitHost monthly and uses GitLab CE then the provisioning is handled by githost.io. 

For customer who purchase GitHost and GitLab EE yearly then this needs to be handled by our sales team.

If you encounter other requests such as return/recharge then  please coordinate with both Support and Sales.
