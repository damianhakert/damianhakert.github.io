## Setting Ticket Priority

Manually setting a ticket's priority in Zendesk will change the overall ticket [SLA](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/#sla), for first and next time reply. This allows support to more effectively prioritise the active ticket queue.

### Prioritisation to SLA (non-premium customers)

| Priority | First/Next Reply - SLA (business hours) |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| Low      |  16 hours                               |
| Normal   |  12 hours                               |
| High     |  8 hours                                |
| Urgent   |  4 hours                                |
