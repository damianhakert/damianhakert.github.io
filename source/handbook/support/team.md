# Interactions within the Support Team

## Expectations of the support team

As members of the support team we are the first to interact with someone when they have a problem or question.
As such it is up to us to represent the company and make sure we present ourselves properly. Therefore we are
expected to:

- Always be friendly and respectful
- Be open to new ideas and points of view
- It is OK if you don't know something. You can always ask someone else
- It is OK to say no to a customer, but try to suggest a workaround and escalate to a Senior if necessary

## Support Level Agreements

- Emergency tickets should be answered within 30 minutes.
- Tickets from customers should be answered within 1 business day, preferably sooner.
- Tickets from social channels don't have a set SLA, ideally they should be answered within 48 hours

## First steps when you join the team

When you first join the team everything will be new to you. In order to get you started with GitLab quickly
you should take some time to go through our [documentation](http://doc.gitlab.com).

To familiarize yourself with ZenDesk, you can follow [this guide](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203921213).
This great resource written by ZenDesk Support will help you better know how ZenDesk works and how you can
use it to be more productive.

You should also familiarize yourself with the GitLab codebase. A great place to start is by installing the
[GDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-development-kit). Any problem that our customers have will first
go through you, so you need to make sure you understand the issue and are able to radiate the information
you collect in a precise manner to the rest of the team. Make sure that you know how to install and upgrade
GitLab using our different installation methods:

- Omnibus (preferred)
- Docker
- From source

It is also encouraged to go over your colleagues responses to previously submitted tickets, to see how they
craft their replies, and to get more insight and knowledge into topics with which you are unfamiliar.

## Specific actions within ZenDesk

### Assigning a ticket to you

Assign a ticket to yourself the moment you decide you are going to work on it. If the nature of the problem
requires you to investigate further, let the customer know that you need further time to investigate, assign
the ticket to you, and submit the reply. By assigning the ticket to yourself you are letting your team members
know that you will work with this customer and by replying to the customer, even if you need further time to
craft a proper answer, you are acknowledging their request.

### Responding to tickets

For responses to regularly asked question see the [common responses](/handbook/support/common-responses.html)
section.

Tickets coming from our customers take a higher priority than regular support tickets and are marked as such
within ZenDesk. Make sure you take care of these tickets first. They can be seen in the `Subscribers Open`
view.

**After the first response**

In most cases when you reply to a customer you expect a reply back. In this case the ticket should be
marked as `Pending`. If this ticket doesn't receive a reply within 7 days, you should follow up with
the customer. If this is your second response without a reply you can mark the ticket as solved at this
point, otherwise ask them if they still need help or have further questions.

When a feature request or the fix for a bug has been scheduled for a future release, you should let the
customer know about the versio for which this has been scheduled and when that version is going to be
releases, e.g. June 22nd for 8.9, and add the `promised` tag to the ZenDesk ticket.

**How to escalate a ticket?**

If you need help with a ticket, you can ask any of your colleagues to assist you. You can do this via
Slack. If the person you know can help you the best (expert on a specific topic) is not available on
Slack, you can assign the ticket to them, add a comment summarizing the situation, and submit the
ticket as **open**.

**When to mark a ticket as solved?**

A ticket can be marked as solved when you are certain that you were able to resolve the requester's
problem, or, as mentioned above, when many days go by without a reply from the requester.

**Receiving negative feedback**

After 24 hours of marking the ticket as solved a survey is sent to our customers, where they can rate
the level of support they received. If a customer rates a ticket to which you were assigned as bad, an
email will be sent to you and the ZenDesk manager to notify you of the fact. When this happens, you should
let a Senior know about the problem and follow up with the customer to see if something you did can
be improved.

## Team member is unavailable

### Vacation

You are encouraged to take as many vacations days as you need, as per our [handbook](/handbook). There
are, however, some things to consider when a member of the support team takes a vacation.

**24/7 schedule must be covered**

Before leaving for vacation, 2 weeks before at the latest, you should coordinate with your colleagues
to see who can take over the days when you should be on-call. This can happen via an issue in our
[Organization Repo](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues?label_name=pagerduty) or via
a Hangout that you should schedule.

**Rest of the team**

At any point in time at least half of the support team must be available to handle all our tasks, so
be sure to let everyone know about your plans as soon as you know something. This can be done in the
Availability Calendar. Vacation days are first come first served.

**Tickets assigned to you**

Try to solve as many of the tickets that are assigned to you as you can and try not to take on too many
difficult tickets right before you leave. If there are still tickets assigned to you that you will not
be able to handle, talk to your colleagues to see who can take over them.

### Illness

You should always take care of yourself and make sure you are healthy. If you need to take a sick day, let
your team members know. If there is an important ticket pending, aks one of your colleagues to help you if
you foresee you will be unavailable for more than 1 day.

If you are on call for the 24/7 support, ask one of your colleagues to cover for you.

### Unforeseen events

If you need to take care of something urgent, there is no need to ask for permission. Just notify the team
via the #support channel in Slack. If you are on call for the 24/7 support, ask one of your colleagues to
cover for you.
