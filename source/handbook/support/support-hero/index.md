Contributing to GitLab is not limited to just code. Our community is made up of people from different countries and cultures that help us by adding features to our codebase, improving documentation, and helping other users.

The title of _Support Hero_ is awarded to community members with an outstanding work helping others. Every month, we select a new Support Hero from the rest of the community, and add them to this page.

Winners receive a [Swag store](https://gitlab.mybrightsites.com) credit code for their contribution and a mention in our release blog post.

The process of Support Hero selection consists of the following steps:

+ **1st of each month:** Nominations start on an internal issue tagged with the _Support_ label.
+ **20th of each month:** Support Hero nominations close, Hero of the month gets selected, receives notification and the Swag store code.
+ **22th of each month (Release Day):** Support Hero is publicly acknowledged in the release blog post.
