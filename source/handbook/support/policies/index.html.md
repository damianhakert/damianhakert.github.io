### Removal of 2FA <a name="2faremoval"></a>

[Two-factor Authentication](http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/profile/two_factor_authentication.html) (2FA)
can only be removed from a GitLab.com account if one of the following combinations are met:

#### Combination 1:

Push a certain file to a repository in a personal project

#### Combination 2:

Photo ID and picture of user with ID

Examples:

+ Driver's License
+ Passport
+ Military/Government ID
+ Permanent Resident Cards


### Dormant Usernames <a name="dormantusers"></a>

Support often gets requests from gitlab.com users to release a username.
This can be implemented if the following criteria are met:

1. The account in question has no data.
1. There hasn't been any activity on the account (i.e. code, issues, merge requests)
   for six months. This considers activity on projects the account owns
   as well as activity on projects the account participants in.
1. Support has had two failed attempts to contact the user within a
 two week period.   
1. The user cannot be an owner of any active project.

Usernames will be appended with `_idle` to keep the account active but
release the namespace.

Support agents will not release a current user's contact information to another
user. GitLab also will not contact a user on behalf of another user to request
surrender of an apparently active username.

### Code of Conduct<a name="coc"></a>

Just as service engineers are expected to adhere to the [Code of
Conduct](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct), we
also expect customers to treat service engineers with the same level of respect.

If you receive threatening or hostile emails from a user, please create a
confidential issue in the [GitLab Support Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues)
and include:

1. A history of the user's communication
1. Relevant links
1. Summary of the high-level issues

Include the Support Lead, VP of Engineering, and Director of PeopleOps in this issue. Together we will
evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether to take action (e.g. ban the user from the forums
for violating the Code of Conduct).
