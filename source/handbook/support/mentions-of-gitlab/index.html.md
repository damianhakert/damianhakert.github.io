## Mentions Channel

We use the [mentions-of-gitlab](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/mentions-of-gitlab/)  slack channel to track mentions of GitLab across multiple sources to allow us to respond to user requests across various platforms.

We currently track for GitLab mentions across the following sources:

1. Product Hunt
2. Tumblr
3. HackerNews
4. Reddit

We use [notify.ly](https://notify.ly/)  to track and pipe these mentions to the mentions-of-gitlab channel
