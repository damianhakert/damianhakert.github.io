# The SAML Bootcamp is being born in an issue

Right now, the single source of truth is [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues/432)
so that it can change rapidly. If you want to start the bootcamp or start
collaborating on it, please ping De Wet and move the checklist to this page.

Create an issue with this checklist on the [support team issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues/)
with the **Title:** *"SAML Bootcamp - your_name"*

Tackle stage 1 first and the last stage last, but the others can be completed in
any order you prefer.
