Tackle stage 1 first and the last stage last, but the others can be completed in
any order you prefer.

1. [ ] Read the [GitHost FAQs](https://about.gitlab.com/githost-faq/)
1. [ ] Read the [introduction to GitHost](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/GitHost/blob/master/doc/introduction.md)
1. [ ] Watch the [introduction to GitHost video](https://drive.google.com/a/gitlab.com/file/d/0B0zUJJYhL0-ycXlsT3VtdjJ3cW8/view?usp=drive_web)

1. [ ] Find answers to the following question
