##### Overview

There will be tickets where having shell access to production GitLab.com will be helpful in
debugging the issue. In such a case, please escalate to a Senior Service Engineer. Currently
production access is only granted to Senior Service Engineers.

Here are some examples of such issues:

1. Some user action is triggering an error on GitLab.com
1. There's a bug that seems to be on production only and you are not able to reproduce it locally.

In either case, please provide as much information as you can. Logs and Sentry errors should be
the gold standard here.
