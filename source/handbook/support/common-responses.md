### <a name="required-information"></a> Required Information

Support requests that donâ€™t have enough information to process require asking the user for this information. The basic 
information that is usually needed is the GitLab version, Operating System and production logs found

#### Upgrades from old versions
* Problem Description:  
Upgrades from GitLab ~6.6 encounter migration errors when trying to update to the latest 
version ~8.2. 
* Expected Behavior:  
When following the guides ate the [omnibus-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/update/README.md#upgrading-from-a-non-omnibus-installation-to-an-omnibus-installation) 
project installation should run smoothly.
* Solution:  
Some migrations are executed out of order and are required to be ran specifically.  
Migrate with ```sudo gitlab-rake db:migrate```
If its still complicated then upgrade to 7.10 before upgrading to 8.2.
