## Support and Development Process

### Problem

* Slow response time because support waits for Dmitriy's decision. Dmitriy will try to reply quicker. Please try to keep in mind the following things to make the process more efficient.

### Types of issues

* Bug

* Unpaid feature request

* Paid feature request

### Bug process

* Make sure it looks like bug - otherwise ping one of developers (Valery, Marin) to confirm

* Reproduce bug

* Assign next milestone  (current 1.0 then assign 1.1)

* Report back to customer

### Unpaid feature request process

* Provide maximum information and use case from customer in the issue, mention any alternatives, how badly the customer wants it

* Ask Dmitriy for opinion (do we want this feature in GitLab: yes/no. Dmitriy might ask more questions before answer) 

* Assign to milestone after next milestone (current 1.0 then assign 1.2)

### Paid feature request process

* Points 1 and 2 of the Unpaid feature request process

* Ask for an estimate

* Assign to next milestone (current 1.0 then assign 1.1)
