## Communication<a name="reach-engineering"></a>

- [**Public Issue Tracker (for GitLab CE)**](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce); please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at GitLab.
- [**Chat channel**](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/development); please use the `#development` , `#frontend`, `#infrastructure`, and `#support` chat channels for questions that don't seem appropriate to use the issue tracker or the internal email address for.

## Engineering Groups

- [Support](/handbook/support)
- [Infrastructure](/handbook/infrastructure)
- [Backend]() TODO
- [Frontend]() TODO
- [Packaging]() TODO

### Coordination Among Groups

Many issues can be handled by a single person, but more complex issues may require
a significant amount of work from different groups. For example, many features
may require backend and frontend work. Since involving more people can
slow down progress, we encourage the following guidelines:

* For small issues, frontend developers are free to attempt the necessary backend work and vice versa.
* For medium-sized issues, there should be a designated frontend and backend developer
who work together.
* For large issues, there should be a whole team involving UX, frontend, backend, and product.
* Arrange a direct call with the team when starting the issue.

When in doubt, feel free to ask whether the issue really needs a dedicated
person in each group.

In all cases, we encourage communicating throughout the process so that there will
be fewer questions when a merge request is reviewed. Regardless of the size of
the issue, a backend developer making UI changes should ping a UI/UX person
early in the process, just as a frontend developer making backend changes should
contact a backend person for an early review.
