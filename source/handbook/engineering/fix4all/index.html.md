title: "fix4all: Developer Rotation on the Support Team"
---

## Background

The support team fields a wide array of questions from customers, and
we as the company learn quite a lot about ways to improve GitLab just
by helping our customers. In addition, sometimes customer-reported
bugs get addressed in a timely manner, but other times they remain
unfixed for quite some time.

## Introducing fix4all

fix4all is a rotation where one developer will spend a week of
his/her time helping the support team. There are several goals:

1. Reduce the time it takes to resolve customer tickets.
1. Reduce the time to fix customer bugs.
1. Increase the shared knowledge between developers and service engineers.
1. Increase customer awareness within the development team.
1. Foster better cooperation between members of different groups.

## Implementation

Every month, we will assign four developers to be on the fix4all
rotation. Each developer will be assigned a week within that month
to focus on helping support.

### Tasks

Each developer will be assigned a week where they work directly with
the support team. The exact day-to-day tasks may vary depending on the
most pressing needs at the moment. See the [Support
Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/) for more
details.

### Bugs

If customer ticket load appears under control, a person on the fix4all
rotation should fix customer bugs, starting with the highest priority
items in the [GitLab
CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?scope=all&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=customer&sort=priority)
and [EE issue
trackers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues?scope=all&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=customer&sort=priority).
