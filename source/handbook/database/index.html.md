The Database team is focusing on the database-specific areas to enable GitLab
scale with increasing number of users and projects. This includes various
techniques including:

* Sharding at the application-level or with tools such as [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com/)
* Providing tools for the development team test migrations before they hit production
* Creating tools to enable online migrations that require little or no downtime
* Providing monitoring for slow queries
* Tuning PostgreSQL and MySQL for optimal usage
