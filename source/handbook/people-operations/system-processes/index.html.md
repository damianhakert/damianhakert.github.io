## Processing Changes

### Compensation and Title Changes

Any change to compensation or title requested by a manager must be approved by processing it in BambooHR. The Manager (Reports To) should initiate the change by logging into BambooHR to complete the approval workflow.  Once initiated, the workflow will push the transaction to the Manager's Manager, the People Ops Business Partner, the CEO, and the People Operations Administrator for processing.

If you have any questions throughout this process, please feel free to contact People Ops. People Ops will confirm the change as the last step in the approval process. This ensures that further changes may need to be [processed in TriNet](#changes-trinet) or HRSavvy to fully process the change. People Ops
is responsible for seeing the change through to completion. Once completed, People Ops
sends an email to the person reporting / requesting the change (member's manager or CEO)
to confirm this.

If you feel your title is not aligned with your skill level or you are interested in the career ladder ahead, you should discuss your personal professional development plan with your manager or the People Operations Generalist.

#### Process for Compensation and Title Change in BambooHR

Manager (Reports To):

1. Login to BambooHR.
1. Select the team member you would like to adjust.
1. In the top right hand corner, click Request a Change.

1. Enter in all applicable fields in the form, and then submit.
1. If there was a title change associated with the request, People Ops will complete a merge request to change the title on the Team Page.

#### Process for Recommending a Team Member for a Bonus in BambooHR

## Using BambooHR

We use [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.
We don't have one contact person but can call BambooHR if we want any changes made in the platform. The contact info lives in the Secretarial Vault in 1Password.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action:

1. document what the process will be regarding this action (e.g. "need information X") for
_new_ team members. (Recall that we strive to change processes by documenting them, not vice versa).
1. make sure _that it is necessary_  for the entire team to act, or whether the
work can be done by People Ops (even if this is tedious to do for People Ops, it
is preferred, so as not to burden the team),
1. make sure that the call to action is OK-ed by management,
1. and check the steps to be taken by testing them with a single team member or a
test account that does not have admin privileges.
1. in the note to the team, point to the documentation created in step 1, explain the need and
the ask, and who to turn to in case of questions.

Once the bonus has been processed, change the note in BambooHR to denote the referral bonus has been paid.

### Asset Tracking

Items paid for by the company are property of the company.

Assets with purchasing value in excess of $1000 USD are tracked in BambooHR, for assets of lower value we rely on the honor system. These assets come to People Ops attention by one of two ways: 1. People Ops makes the purchase on behalf of the team member, or 2. the Finance team notices the line items on expense reports / invoices and passes this along to People Ops.

The information is then entered into BambooHR (to track who has which piece of equipment) by People Ops, and it is included in the Fixed Asset Schedule by Finance (to track asset value and depreciation).

1. Go to the team member in BambooHR
1. Click on the Assets Tab
1. Click Update Assets
1. Enter Asset Category, Asset Description, Serial Number, Asset Cost, and Date Loaned
1. This process is repeated for each asset purchased
