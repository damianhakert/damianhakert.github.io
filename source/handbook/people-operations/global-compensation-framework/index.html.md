title: Global Compensation Framework
---

As a natural extension of our [Compensation Principles](/handbook/people-operations/#compensation-principles), and our commitment to transparency, sharing, efficiency, directness, and boring solutions (amongst other [values](/handbook/people-operations/#values)), we developed a Global Compensation Framework. As with all things at GitLab, this framework and the compensation calculator that came from it are a work in progress.
