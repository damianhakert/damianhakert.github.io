## Role of People Operations<a name="role-peopleops"></a>

In general, the People Operations team and processes are here as a service to the rest of the team; helping make your life easier so that you can focus on your work and contributions to GitLab. On that note, please don't hesitate to [reach out](#reach-peopleops) with questions! In the case of a conflict between the company and a team member, People Operations works "on behalf of" the company.

## Team Directory<a name="directory"></a>

The [team directory](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com/employees/directory.php?pin) is in BambooHR, and is accessible to all team members. This is your one-stop directory for phone numbers and addresses (in case you want to send your team mate an awesome card!).

- Please make sure that your own information stays up to date, and reach out to People Ops if you need any help in doing so.
- Please make sure that your address and phone information are written in such a way that your team mates can reach you from a different country. So, for example, include `+[country code]` in front of your phone number.


## Office addresses<a name="addresses"></a>

- For the SF office, see our [visiting](https://about.gitlab.com/visiting/) page.
- For the NL office, we use a postbox address listed in the "GitLab BV address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password. We use [addpost](www.addpost.nl) to scan our mail and send it along to a physical address upon request. The scans are sent via email to the email alias listed in the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc.

## Policies<a name="policies"></a>

### Compensation principles<a name="compensation-principles"></a>

1. We're an open organization and want to be transparent about compensation principles, while not disclosing individual compensation. We're working on having a formula for compensation but this is hard due to the need make the formula work across the globe.
1. Compensation is based on market rate for the region, your job title, and your (expected) level of performance.
1. We pay market rate for most non-engineering positions, and have the better-than-market benefit of being a remote-only company (flexible, freedom).
1. We pay on the lower end of market rates for engineering positions because we offer the benefit of working on open source (great workflow, peers, build reputation); most engineers take a pay cut to join.
1. We also offer [stock options](/handbook/stock-options/) for most positions.
1. We base compensation on current position and performance, not on what we paid you last month. This means 50% raises are possible, but also that there are no automatic raises, and we even (although rarely) lower compensation.
1. When your position or performance changes we'll try to adjust your pay as soon as possible: the manager should take initiative, people should not have to ask for it. But people are free to ask if their manager if they think they are due for a raise.
1. The market rate depends on your metro region. When you move you have to inform us and we may adjust your compensation up or down.
1. We hire across the globe but we're not location agnostic. Your timezone, the market rate in your region, and vicinity to other team members, users, customers, and partners can all be factors. For example, we may favor an applicant over another because they live in a region with a lower market rate or because we need someone in that timezone. All things being equal we will hire people in lower cost markets vs. higher cost markets.
1. As you can see from our [contracts](/handbook/contracts/), compensation is typically set at a fixed monthly rate. People on quota (account executives, account managers, and sales leadership) have variable compensation that is about 50% of their On Target Earnings (OTE). Individual contributors in the sales organization have variable compensation that is purely based on commission, for leadership roles sometimes part of it is based on business objectives. Success engineers currently have a lower variable component, we're not sure how this will evolve. All other people have fixed compensation (but we do have [bonuses and incentives](/handbook/#incentives)).
1. Compensation decisions are taken by the compensation committee. This committee consists of the CFO, CEO, and head of people operations. When there is no time to coordinate with the committee the CEO can take a decision and inform the committee.

### Sick time - taking and reporting<a name="sick-time"></a>

In keeping with our [values](/handbook/#values) of freedom, efficiency, transparency, kindness, and boring solutions, we have crafted the following protocol around sick leave for all team members.

**All team members**

- If you or a loved one is ill, we want you to take care of yourself or your loved one(s). To facilitate this, you should take sick leave when you need it. Sick leave is meant to be used when you are ill, or to care for family members including your parent(s), child(ren), spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent(s), grandchild(ren), and sibling(s).
- You do need to report when you take sick leave, either by emailing your manager and People Ops, or by using the "Request time off" function in BambooHR. This way, it can be tracked in BambooHR and related payroll systems.
- If you need sick leave for more than 8 consecutive calendar days, notify your manager and People Ops to accommodate an extended leave request. What can (or must) be accommodated varies from location to location: GitLab will comply with the applicable laws in your specific location.
- Upon request, you should be able to provide proper documentation of the reason for your sick leave (doctor's note).

**Details for specific groups of team members**

- Employees of GitLab Inc. who receive a pay stub from TriNet will see sick time accrue on their pay stub at the rate of 0.0346 hrs per hour worked (3 hours of sick leave per semi-monthly pay-period) for a maximum accrual and carry-over of 72 hours per year. GitLab's policy is more generous than this, in the sense that you can take off non-accrued sick time as written above (a negative balance may show on your pay stub). Sick time does not get paid out in case of termination, nor does it reduce your final paycheck in case of a negative balance. Related to the topic of extended leave requests, see information about [short term disability](/handbook/benefits/#std-ltd) through TriNet / your state.
- Employees of GitLab B.V. have further rights and responsibilities regarding sick time based on Dutch law, as written into their employment [contracts](#handbook/contracts).

### Hiring Significant Other or Family Members<a name="family-hires"></a>

GitLab is committed to a policy of employment and advancement based on **qualifications and merit** and does not discriminate in favor of or in opposition to the employment of significant others or relatives. Due to the potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, which can be carried into the daily working relationship, GitLab will hire or consider other employment actions concerning significant others and/or relatives of persons currently employed or contracted only if:   
a) candidates for employment will not be working directly for or supervising a significant other or relative, and
b) candidates for employment will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which employees can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to the significant other or relative. Such decisions include hiring, retention, transfer, promotion, wages and leave requests.

This policy applies to all current employees and candidates for employment.

### Returning property to GitLab<a name="returning-property"></a>

As part of [offboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/offboarding/), any GitLab property needs to be returned to GitLab. GitLab will pay for the shipping either by People Ops sending a FedEx shipping slip or it can be returned by another mutually agreed method. If property is not returned, GitLab reserves the right to use a creditor company to help retrieve the property.

#### FedEx info for the team member <a name="fedex-info"></a>

Pull up the departing contributors home address. Find a Fedex location close to them. Then follow the template below.

"Hi [Name of team member]

The closest Fedex to you is located on [full street address, city, state, zip code]. Driving or walking directions can be found here: [enter link from “mapping home location to the Fedex location”]

Once there you can use Fedex boxes that you need and do the following actions:

1. Package the equipment in the box
2. Send package to GitLab HQ in San Francisco
3. Mark on the invoice "Bill Recipient"
4. Our Fedex number is: [find the number in Secretarial Vault in 1Password]
5. Provide People Ops the tracking number via email

Please let People Ops know if you have any questions."



## Methods and Tools for People Ops<a name="peopleops-methods"></a>

### Setting up new contracts<a name="new-contracts"></a>

New team hire contracts are found on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page, including instructions on how to set up new contracts.


#### Using HelloSign<a name="hellosign"></a>

When we need [contracts to be signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) we use [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).
Follow these steps to send out a signature request.

1. Choose who needs to sign. (just me, me & others, or just others)
1. Upload your document that needs signing
1. Enter the names of the people that need to sign
1. With more than one signature required, assign signing order (for contracts or offer letters, always have the GitLab Signatory sign first)
1. Add the People Ops team to the cc
1. Click on "Prepare Docs for signing"
1. Drag & Drop the Signature and Date fields to the corresponding empty spaces in the document (you can select the signee with the pop up screen)
1. For GitLab Inc. agreements, add a required textbox to Exhibit A, and a supplemental larger textbox below for a comment that is not required.
1. Add a title and a message for the recipient. For contract use for example: "Dear [...], You can sign [document type] with HelloSign. Once you've signed you will receive a copy by email. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out"
1. Request Signature.

Once you've sent out the document you will receive email notifications of the progress and a copy of the signed document after all parties have signed.
If you need to make a change, there is an "Edit & Resend" option in HelloSign. If a new document has to be uploaded, cancel the original and stage a new one to send for signatures.

### Processing changes<a name="processing-changes"></a>

Any changes to a team member’s status, classification, promotion/demotion, pay increase/decrease and
bonus needs to be communicated via email to People Ops by the team member's manager or CEO. People Ops will then enter
the changes in BambooHR under the relevant section on the Jobs tab in the member’s profile; and then file the email in the Contracts and Changes folder in the Document tab.

Further changes may need to be [processed in TriNet](#changes-trinet) or Savvy to fully process the change. People Ops
is responsible for seeing the change through to completion. Once completed, People Ops
sends an email to the person reporting / requesting the change (member's manager or CEO)
to confirm this.


### Using BambooHR<a name="bamboohr"></a>

We use [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.
We don't have one contact person but can call BambooHR if we want any changes made in the platform. The contact info lives in the Secretarial Vault in 1Password.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action:

1. document what the process will be regarding this action (e.g. "need information X") for
_new_ team members. (Recall that we strive to change processes by documenting them, not vice versa).
1. make sure _that it is necessary_  for the entire team to act, or whether the
work can be done by People Ops (even if this is tedious to do for People Ops, it
is preferred, so as not to burden the team),
1. make sure that the call to action is OK-ed by management,
1. and check the steps to be taken by testing them with a single team member or a
test account that does not have admin privileges.
1. in the note to the team, point to the documentation created in step 1, explain the need and
the ask, and who to turn to in case of questions.

1. Go to the Employee in BambooHR
1. Click on the Assets Tab
1. Click Update Assets
1. Enter Asset Category, Asset Description, Serial Number, Asset Cost, and Date Loaned
1. This process is repeated for each asset purchased

People Ops should recieve a confirmation and receipt via email after placing an order. Make sure to upload these receipts with your next expense report through [Expensify](/handbook/#spending-company-money). You can automatically do this by forwarding all receipts to receipts@expensify.com.

### Managing the PeopleOps onboarding tasks <a name="manage-onboarding-tasks"></a>

Here are some useful guidelines to set up everything for our new team members with the onboarding issue.
If Google Sheets or Docs are mentioned, these will be shared with you on Google Drive.

- **Add team member to availability calendar**
Make a new "all-day" event on the day the new team member starts "[Name] joining
as [Job title]". Make sure to select the calendar as GitLab Availability and not your own.
- **Give team member access to the GitLab availability calendar**
Go to your calendar window, under my calendars move your cursor over the calendar
and click the dropdown triangle. Select calendar settings and go to "Share this
calendar" in the top of the window. Enter the GitLab email address and scroll
down to set the permission setting to "make changes to events" Then save in the
lower left corner.
- **Add blank entry to team page**<a name="blank-entry"></a>
Login to [Gitlab.com](www.gitlab.com) and go to the www-gitlab-com project. In
the left menu click "Files," select "data," and choose the file called team.yml. In the top right
corner you can click "edit" to make edits to the code. Scroll all the way down
and copy-paste the code of the previous blank entry to the team page. Edit the
fields to the right info of the new hire and find the right job description URL on
the [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page. Do not include the employee's name in the commit message, only initials.  
 **Note** _This can be tricky, so if you run into trouble reach out to some of
your awesome colleagues in the #questions (channel) on Slack_
- **Add entry to Team Call agenda**
Open the Team Agenda google doc, and on the starting day add an Agenda item:
"[Hiring manager name]: Welcome [name new team member] joining as [job title]"
as the first item on the agenda
- **Create new profile for team member in BambooHR, and input relevant data**
Once the new team member has been transfered from Workable to BambooHR, go to the Dashboard and search their name. Under the Personal tab, add country, work email, and personal email. Under the Job tab, enter the compensation from the contract. Note: We do not use the pay period or pay type option in this list, but BambooHR cannot remove it.
Next enter job information. Be sure to verify the proper title and contract type.
- **Invite to team meeting and GitLab 101 meeting**
Go to the team call meeting on the starting date of the team member and the next
scheduled GitLab 101 in the Availability calendar. Click on "edit event" to open.
On the right enter the team member's GitLab email address in the  "add guests"
section and click save. When asked select "all events" to add to all scheduled
meetings and "send" out the invitation.
- **Send swag codes to new team members**
To celebrate a new team member joining our team, send an email with $50 swag credits for our [Swag Store](https://gitlab.mybrightsites.com/), as noted in the onboarding issue. You can get the codes for the swag by finding the Google doc titled "Tshirt and stickers coupons 2.12.16".
- **Order business cards**
Go BambooHR and enter the info needed for the Business Cards. This is found by clicking on More, then selecting Business Cards. Select Update Business Card Requests and fill out all the pertinent fields.
Email our partner to order new business cards. Include the address of the team member (found in BambooHR) and inform our partner to _**ship the cards directly to that address**_. Double check the info that is sent with the preview before approving the print.
- **Add team member to Expensify (only with employees)**<a name="add-expensify"></a>
Login to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/signin) and go to "Admin" in the top menu. Select the right policy based upon the entity that employs the new team member. Select "People" in the left menu. Select "Invite" and add the GitLab email. Edit the message to be sent for the employee. Click "invite".

Login in to access the settings for the [Beam](https://suitabletech.com/accounts/login/). In the top menu move your cursor over the blue login button. Go to "Manage your beams". Click on "manage" in the lower left corner. Enter the GitLab email and scroll down to find the newly addedd email. Check the box for "Auto connect".
- **Add team member into the Summit info sheets**
Add the team member's name to the Travel and Lodging Google sheets to make sure they enter flight details and will be assigned a room.
- **Add team member to our Egencia platform**<a name="add-egencia"></a>
Log into Egencia and go to the menu option "manage users". Choose "new user account" and fill in the passport name of the new team member.
As username choose the same handle as on our dev domain. Enter the GitLab email address and uncheck the newsletter box.

## Paperwork people may need to obtain mortgage in the Netherlands<a name="dutch-mortgage"></a>

When your employment contract is for a fixed period of time (e.g. 12 months) you'll need a "werkgeversverklaring".
This document describes your salary and states that your employer expects to continue to employ
you after the contract expires (assuming the performance of the employee doesn't degrade).
This document has to be filled in by hand, preferably using blue ink, and must be signed
and stamped. If there is no stamp (as is the case for GitLab) an extra letter (also signed)
must be supplied that states the employer has no stamp. While the language of these
documents doesn't matter, the use of Dutch is preferred.

Employees also have to provide a copy of a payslip that clearly states not only their
monthly salary but also their annual salary. These numbers must match the numbers on
the "werkgeversverklaring" down to the decimals. Mortgage providers may also require
you to provide information about your financial status, usually in the form of a report/screenshot
of your total financial status (including any savings you have). The requirements for
this seem to vary a bit between mortgage providers.

## Involuntary Terminations<a name="involuntary-terminations"></a>

Involuntary termination of any team member is never easy. We've created some guidelines and information to make this process as painless and easy as possible for everyone involved. Beyond the points outlined below, make sure to refer to our guidelines on [underperformance](/handbook/underperformance), as well as the [offboarding](/handbook/offboarding/) checklist.

### Overall process

Ideally, the manager and the team member have walked through the guidelines on [underperformance](/handbook/underperformance) before reaching this point.

1. Manager: reach out to People Operations for assistance. People Ops will ask about what the performance issues have been, how they have been attempted to be addressed, and will then prepare for the termination.
1. Manager and People Ops: discuss best mode of communicating the bad news to the team member. This discussion can happen via a private chat-channel, but it is best to be done via a video hangout. Set up a private chat-channel in any case, since this is also useful to have during the eventual call with the affected team member.
1. Manager and People Ops: Decide who will handle which part of the conversation, and if desired, practice it. It is strongly advised to have someone from People Ops on the call when the bad news is delivered.
1. Manager and People Ops: Decide what offboarding actions need to be taken _before_ the call (e.g. revoke admin permissions), or _during_ the call (e.g. revoke Slack and Gmail access), and which ones can wait until later (see the [offboarding checklist](/handbook/offboarding)). Make sure someone with the necessary admin privileges is on hand (in the private chat-channel) to assist with those sensitive offboarding steps that should occur relatively quickly. Do not create the offboarding issue until _after_ the call, since even confidential issues are still visible to anyone in the team.
1. Manager: Set up a call with the team member in question. Make a separate private calendar event to invite the People Ops representative.
1. On the call: deliver the bad news up-front, do not beat around the bush and prolong the inevitable pain for everyone involved. A sample leading sentence can be "Thanks for joining the call ___ . Unfortunately, the reason I wanted to speak with you, is because we have decided that we have to let you go and end your employment / contract with GitLab." At this point, hand over the call to People Ops to continue. People Ops explains what led to this decision and points to the process that was followed to reach this decision. People Ops to make it clear that the decision is final, but also to genuinely listen to their side of the story since there may be useful lessons in what they say for the rest of the team e.g. regarding hiring and vetting practices.
1. People Ops: Make sure to communicate the [practical points](#offboarding-points) from the termination memo outlined below.
1. People Ops: Create the [offboarding checklist issue](/handbook/offboarding), and go from there.


### Points to cover during the offboarding call, with sample wording<a name="offboarding-points"></a>

The following points need to be covered for any team member:

1. Final Pay: "your final check (or invoice period) is for the pay period of X and includes X days of pay”.
