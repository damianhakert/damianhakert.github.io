## Reaching People Operations<a name="reach-peopleops"></a>

To reach People Operations, please post an issue on our [internal issue tracker](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues/)
and add the 'PeopleOps' label, or send an email to the People Operations group (see the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc), or ping an individual
member of the People Operations team, as listed on our [Team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).

## Office addresses<a name="addresses"></a>

- For the SF office, see our [visiting](https://about.gitlab.com/visiting/) page.
- For the NL office, we use a postbox address listed in the "GitLab BV address" note in the Shared vault on 1Password. We use [addpost](www.addpost.nl) to scan our mail and send it along to a physical address upon request. The scans are sent via email to the email alias listed in the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc.


## Setting up new hiring contracts<a name="new-contracts"></a>

New team hire contracts are found on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page, including instructions on how to set up new contracts.
Templates for the contracts are set up in BambooHR. You can download the template from the "Files" tab and work on the contract using Google Drive. Here you can work together if you need help and download the PDF for HelloSign.


### Using HelloSign<a name="hellosign"></a>

When we need [contracts to be signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) we use [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).
Follow these steps to send out a signature request.

1. Choose who needs to sign. (just me, me & others, or just others)
1. Upload your document that needs signing
1. Enter the names of the people that need to sign
1. With more than one signature required, assign signing order (for contracts or offer letters, always have the GitLab Signatory sign first)
1. Add the People Ops team to the cc
1. Click on "Prepare Docs for signing"
1. Drag & Drop the Signature and Date fields to the corresponding empty spaces in the document (you can select the signee with the pop up screen)
1. Add a title and a message for the recipient. For contract use for example: "Dear [...], You can sign [document type] with HelloSign. Once you've signed you will receive a copy by email. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out"
1. Request Signature.

Once you've sent out the document you will receive email notifications of the progress and a copy of the signed document after all parties have signed.

## Processing changes<a name="processing-changes"></a>

Any changes to a team member’s status, classification, promotion/demotion, pay increase/decrease and
bonus needs to be communicated via email to People Ops by the team member's manager or CEO. People Ops will then enter
the changes in BambooHR under the Jobs Tab in the member’s profile; then file the email in the Offers
and Contracts Folder in the Document Section.

Further changes may need to be [processed in TriNet](#changes-trinet) or Savvy to fully process the change. People Ops
is responsible for seeing the change through to completion. Once completed, People Ops
sends an email to the person reporting / requesting the change (member's manager or CEO)
to confirm this.


## Using BambooHR<a name="bamboohr"></a>

We’re using [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action:  

1. document what the process will be regarding this action (e.g. "need information X") for
_new_ team members. (Recall that we strive to change processes by documenting them, not vice versa).
1. make sure _that it is necessary_  for the entire team to act, or whether the
work can be done by People Ops (even if this is tedious to do for People Ops, it
is preferred, so as not to burden the team),
1. make sure that the call to action is OK-ed by management,
1. and check the steps to be taken by testing them with a single team member or a
test account that does not have admin privileges.
1. in the note to the team, point to the documentation created in step 1, explain the need and
the ask, and who to turn to in case of questions.


## Managing the PeopleOps onboarding tasks <a name="manage-onboarding-tasks"></a>

Here are some useful guidelines to set up everything for our new team members with the onboarding issue.
If Google Sheets or Docs are mentioned, these will be shared with you on Google Drive.

- **Add team member to availability calendar**
Make a new "all-day" event on the day the new team member starts "[Name] joining
as [Job title]". Make sure to select the calendar as GitLab Availability and not your own.
- **Give team member access to the GitLab availability calendar**
Go to your calendar window, under my calendars move your cursor over the calendar
and click the dropdown triangle. Select calendar settings and go to "Share this
calendar" in the top of the window. Enter the GitLab email address and scroll
down to set the permission setting to "make changes to events" Then save in the
lower left corner.
- **Add blank entry to team page**
Login to [Gitlab.com](www.gitlab.com) and go to the www-gitlab-com project. In
the left menu click "Files" and select the folder called "source". Continue by
clicking the folder "data" and select the file called team.yml. In the top right
corner you can click "edit" to make edits to the code. Scroll all the way down
and copy-paste the code of the previous blank entry to the team page. Edit the
fields to the right info of the new hire and find the right job description on
the [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page.
 **Note** _This can be tricky, so if you run into trouble reach out to some of
your awesome colleagues in the #questions (channel) on Slack_
- **Add entry to Team Call agenda**
Open the Team Agenda google doc, and on the starting day add an Agenda item:
"[Hiring manager name]: Welcome [name new team member] joining as [job title]"
as the first item on the agenda
- **Invite to team meeting and GitLab 101 meeting**
Go to the team call meeting on the starting date of the team member and the next
scheduled GitLab 101 in the Availability calendar. Click on "edit event" to open.
On the right enter the team member's GitLab email address in the  "add guests"
section and click save. When asked select "all events" to add to all scheduled
meetings and "send" out the invitation.
- **Order business cards**
Go to the "Notes" field in BambooHR and enter the info needed for the Business Cards.
Once every week/few days or how often needed, run the "Business Cards order" report in the Reports - My Reports menu of BambooHR.
Email our partner to order new business cards and add the info for the cards to
be ordered. Include the address of the team member (found in BambooHR) and inform
our partner to _**ship the cards directly to that address**_. Double check the
info that is sent with the preview before approving the print.
- **Add team member to Expensify (only with employees)**
Login to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/signin) and go to "Admin" in the
top menu. Select the right policy based upon the entity that employs the new team
member. Select "People" in the left menu. Select "Invite" and add the GitLab email.
Edit the message to be sent for the employee. Click "invite".
- **Add team member to Beamy**
Login in to access the settings for the [Beam](https://suitabletech.com/accounts/login/).
In the top menu move your cursor over the blue login button. Go to "Manage your beams".
Click on "manage" in the lower left corner. Enter the GitLab email and scroll down
to find the newly addedd email. Check the box for "Auto connect".
- **Add team member into the Austin info sheets**
Add the team member's name to the Travel and Lodging Google sheets to make sure they enter flight details and they are assigned a room.
- **Add team member to our Egencia platform**
Log into Egencia and go to the menu option "manage users". Choose "new user account" and fill in the passport name of the new team member.
As username choose the same handle as on our dev page. Enter the GitLab email address and uncheck the newsletter box.
Lastly assign the department in which the new team member is working.

## Returning property to GitLab<a name="returning-property"></a>

As part of [offboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/offboarding/), any
GitLab property needs to be returned to GitLab. GitLab
will pay for the shipping either by PeopleOps sending a FedEx shipping slip or it can be returned
by another mutually agreed method. If property is not returned, GitLab reserves the
right to use a creditor company to help retrieve the property.

## Using RingCentral<a name="ringcentral"></a>

Our company and office phone lines are handled via RingCentral. The login credentials
are in the Secretarial vault on 1Password. To add a number to the call handling & forwarding
rules:

- From the Admin Portal, click on the Users button (menu on left), select the user for which you
want to make changes.
- A menu appears to the right of the selected user; pick "Call Handling & Forwarding" and review
the current settings which show all the people and numbers that are alerted when the listed User's
number is dialed.
- Add the new forwarding number (along with a name for the number), and click Save.

## Paperwork people may need to obtain mortgage in the Netherlands<a name="dutch-mortgage"></a>

When your employment contract is for a fixed period of time (e.g. 12 months) you'll need a "werkgeversverklaring".
This document describes your salary and states that your employer expects to continue to employ
you after the contract expires (assuming the performance of the employee doesn't degrade).
This document has to be filled in by hand, preferably using blue ink, and must be signed
and stamped. If there is no stamp (as is the case for GitLab) an extra letter (also signed)
must be supplied that states the employer has no stamp. While the language of these
documents doesn't matter, the use of Dutch is preferred.

Employees also have to provide a copy of a payslip that clearly states not only their
monthly salary but also their annual salary. These numbers must match the numbers on
the "werkgeversverklaring" down to the decimals. Mortgage providers may also require
you to provide information about your financial status, usually in the form of a report/screenshot
of your total financial status (including any savings you have). The requirements for
this seem to vary a bit between mortgage providers.
