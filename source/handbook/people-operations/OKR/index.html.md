### Child Goals vs. Key Results

The key difference between Key Results and Child Goals is ownership: you will own your own Key Results, whereas child goals can be owned by someone else on your team. If you make it a child goal and someone on your team owns it, it'll show up in their personal goals tab, and they'll be responsible for updating it etc. It can still be connected to your goal as a child goal, but you won't be the one owning and updating it.
