New team hire contracts are found on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page, including instructions on how to set up new contracts.

### Using HelloSign<a name="hellosign"></a>

When we need [contracts to be signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) we use [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).
Follow these steps to send out a signature request.

1. Choose who needs to sign. (just me, me & others, or just others)
1. Upload your document that needs signing
1. Enter the names of the people that need to sign
1. With more than one signature required, assign signing order (for contracts or offer letters, always have the GitLab Signatory sign first)
1. Add the People Ops team to the cc
1. Click on "Prepare Docs for signing"
1. Drag & Drop the Signature and Date fields to the corresponding empty spaces in the document (you can select the signee with the pop up screen)
1. Add a title and a message for the recipient. For contract use for example: "Dear [...], You can sign [document type] with HelloSign. Once you've signed you will receive a copy by email. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out"
1. Request Signature.

Once you've sent out the document you will receive email notifications of the progress and a copy of the signed document after all parties have signed.
