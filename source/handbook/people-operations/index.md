## Reaching People Operations<a name="reach-peopleops"></a>

To reach People Operations, please post an issue on our [internal issue tracker](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues/)
and add the 'PeopleOps' label, or send an email to the People Operations group (see the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc), or ping an individual
member of the People Operations team, as listed on our [Team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).

## Setting up new hiring contracts<a name="new-contracts"></a>

New team hire contracts are found on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page, including instructions on how to set up new contracts.
Templates for the contracts are set up in BambooHR. You can download the template from the "Files" tab and work on the contract using Google Drive. Here you can work together if you need help and download the PDF for HelloSign.

### Using HelloSign<a name="hellosign"></a>

When we need [contracts to be signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) we use [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).
Follow these steps to send out a signature request.

1. Choose who needs to sign. (just me, me & others, or just others)
1. Upload your document that needs signing
1. Enter the names of the people that need to sign
1. With more than one signature required, assign signing order (for contracts or offer letters, always have the GitLab Signatory sign first)
1. Add the People Ops team to the cc
1. Click on "Prepare Docs for signing"
1. Drag & Drop the Signature and Date fields to the corresponding empty spaces in the document (you can select the signee with the pop up screen)
1. Add a title and a message for the recipient. For contract use for example: "Dear [...], You can sign [document type] with HelloSign. Once you've signed you will receive a copy by email. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out"
1. Request Signature.

Once you've sent out the document you will receive email notifications of the progress and a copy of the signed document after all parties have signed.

## Using BambooHR<a name="bamboohr"></a>

We’re using [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.

Some changes or additions we make to BambooHR require action from our team members.
Before calling the whole team to action:  

1. document what the process will be regarding this action (e.g. "need information X") for
_new_ team members. (Recall that we strive to change processes by documenting them, not vice versa).
1. make sure _that it is necessary_  for the entire team to act, or whether the
work can be done by People Ops (even if this is tedious to do for People Ops, it
is preferred, so as not to burden the team),
1. make sure that the call to action is OK-ed by management,
1. and check the steps to be taken by testing them with a single team member or a
test account that does not have admin privileges.
1. in the note to the team, point to the documentation created in step 1, explain the need and
the ask, and who to turn to in case of questions.

### Adding a new team member to BambooHR <a name="admin-bamboo"></a>

as described on our [Hiring](/handbook/hiring/) page, follow these steps:

## Returning property to GitLab<a name="returning-property"></a>

As part of [offboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/offboarding/), any
GitLab property needs to be returned to GitLab. GitLab
will pay for the shipping either by PeopleOps sending a FedEx shipping slip or it can be returned
by another mutually agreed method. If property is not returned, GitLab reserves the
right to use a creditor company to help retrieve the property.
