## Reaching People Operations<a name="reach-peopleops"></a>

To reach People Operations, please post an issue on our [internal issue tracker](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues/)
and add the 'PeopleOps' label, or send an email to the People Operations group (see the [sheet with aliases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrVgD2QVixuAf07roYws7Z8rUF2gJKrrmTE4Z3vtENo/edit#)), or ping an individual
member of the People Operations team, as listed on our [Team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).

## Setting up new hiring contracts<a name="new-contracts"></a>

New team hire contracts are found on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page, including instructions on how to set up new contracts.

### Using HelloSign<a name="hellosign"></a>

When we need [contracts to be signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) we use [HelloSign](https://hellosign.com).
Follow these steps to send out a signature request.

1. Choose who needs to sign. (just me, me & others, or just others)
1. Upload your document that needs signing
1. Enter the names of the people that need to sign
1. With more than one signature required, assign signing order (for contracts or offer letters, always have the GitLab Signatory sign first)
1. Add the People Ops team to the cc
1. Click on "Prepare Docs for signing"
1. Drag & Drop the Signature and Date fields to the corresponding empty spaces in the document (you can select the signee with the pop up screen)
1. Add a title and a message for the recipient. For contract use for example: "Dear [...], You can sign [document type] with HelloSign. Once you've signed you will receive a copy by email. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out"
1. Request Signature.

Once you've sent out the document you will receive email notifications of the progress and a copy of the signed document after all parties have signed.

## Using BambooHR<a name="bamboohr"></a>

We’re using [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com) to keep all team member information 
in one place. All team members (all contract types) are in BambooHR.

### Adding a new team member to BambooHR <a name="admin-bamboo"></a>

After People Ops is requested to make a contract or offer letter for a potential hire,
as described on our [Hiring](/handbook/hiring/) page, follow these steps:

1. Download the correct template from the files page on BambooHR
1. Edit the contract or offer letter to include the new hire information.
1. Send out the document to be signed using HelloSign, \cc people ops in this process. (document HelloSign first)
1. Once the document has been signed, create a BambooHR employee file:
   1. Go to the BambooHR Dashboard
   1. Click on the top right on “Add employee”
   1. Enter the following fields: First name, Last name, Gender, Hire date, Employment status, Job information, Pay rate, Salary for employees, or select another option.
   1. Turn “self service” on for the employee to enter the following info: Address, Phone, DOB. private email.
1. Save the signed contract under the Documents tab in the folder “0.Signed Contract/Offer Letter”.
1. On the start date of the employee send out the "password reset email" under the settings option in the top right of the profile (next to "request a change")

### Using BambooHR as a new team member<a name="new-member-bamboo"></a>

Team members can keep their information in BambooHR updated using self-service:

1. Go to the BambooHR link that you should have received by email
1. Change the password to make it secure (see the handbook section on [secure passwords](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/))
1. Login with your new credentials
1. Keep your credentials stored in your 1Password Vault and keep the info in BambooHR updated (e.g. change address when moving)

## Managing the PeopleOps onboarding tasks <a name="manage-onboarding-tasks"></a>
Here are some useful guidelines to set up everything for our new team members with the onboarding issue

Go to your calendar window, under my calendars move your cursor over the calendar and click the dropdown triangle. Select calendar settings and go to "Share this calendar" in the top of the window. Enter the GitLab email address and scroll down to set the permission setting to "make changes to events" Then save in the lower left corner.

Open the [Team Agenda](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1JiLWsTOm0yprPVIW9W-hM4iUsRxkBt_1bpm3VXV4Muc/edit?usp=sharing) and on the starting day add an Agenda item: "[Hiring manager name]: Welcome [name new team member] joining as [job title]" as the first item on the agenda
- **Invite to team meeting and GitLab 101 meeting**
Go to the team call meeting on the starting date of the team member and the next scheduled GitLab 101 in the Availability calendar. Click on "edit event" to open. On the right enter the team member's GitLab email address in the  "add guests" section and click save. When asked select "all events" to add to all scheduled meetings and "send" out the invition.

Email our partner to order new business cards and add the info for the cards to be ordered. Include the address of the team member (found in BambooHR) and inform our partner to _**ship the cards directly to that address**_. Double check the info that is sent with the preview before approving the print.
