## Format

Functional Group Updates are regular updates from a group at GitLab.

1. We'll use Zoom for now, will switch to Youtube Live later.
1. Presentations are optional, if you use them please ensure everyone with the url can access (inside and outside GitLab).
1. All calls except sales and finance are public unless mentioned otherwise, in the future all calls will be public.
1. Right now everyone at GitLab the company is invited to each call, we'll invite the wider community later.
1. Attendence is optional.
1. Video will be published on our blog so contributers, users, and customers can see it. We'll probably publish a week of recordings in one go with [automated transcriptions](https://www.labnol.org/internet/transcribe-video-to-text/28914/)
1. The update is also announced on and the recording linked from our team call agenda.
1. Tone should be informal, like explain to a friend what happend in the group last month, it shouldn't require a lot of presentation.
