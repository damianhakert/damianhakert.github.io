## Format

Functional Group Updates are regular updates from a group at GitLab.

1. We'll use Zoom for now, will switch to YouTube Live later.
1. Presentations are optional, if you use them please ensure everyone with the url can access (inside and outside GitLab).
2. The host should put a link to their presentation in the meeting invitation so that we can read it beforehand (and after if we missed it) just like we do with the agenda in the team call.
1. All calls except sales and finance are public unless mentioned otherwise, in the future all calls will be public.
1. Right now everyone at GitLab the company is invited to each call, we'll invite the wider community later.
1. Attendence is optional.
1. The update is also announced on and the recording linked from our team call agenda.
1. Tone should be informal, like explain to a friend what happend in the group last month, it shouldn't require a lot of presentation.
1. You can invite someone in the team to give it, it doesn't need to be the team lead, but the team lead is responsible that it is given.
1. Calls are 4 times a week 30 minutes before the team call, 8:00 to 8:25am Pacific.
1. Calls do not go over time, if there are more questions invite them via chat, if there are no more questions feel free to end the call after 5 minutes.
1. Calls are scheduled by an [EA](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/executive-assistant/) who can also switch team based on availability of the presenter.
1. Every group with 5 people or more presents.
1. Video recordings will be published on our blog so contributors, users, and customers can see it. We're aiming to publish a blogpost once a week of that weeks' recordings with the matching slides in one go.

### Template for the blogpost

 ## Functional Group updates

Every day from Monday to Thursday, right before our [GitLab team call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call), a different Functional Group gives an [update](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/functional-group-updates/) to our team.
The format of these calls is simple and short where they can either give a presentation or quickly walk the team through their agenda.

 ## Recordings

All of the updates are recorded using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) at the time of the call. All the recordings will be uploaded to our Youtube account and made public, with the exception of the Sales and Finance updates.


* Make sure to use a previous post to take the format of the post and for embedding the video from YouTube into the blogpost
