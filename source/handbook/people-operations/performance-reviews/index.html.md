The following Q & A and process steps explains who should participate in the 2016 performance review process, when reviews must be completed and how the information collected will be used. If you did not receive an invitation from Lattice, and you believe you should have after reading the information below, please email People Ops so we can resolve any issues quickly.

**Q: Why are we doing 2016 performance reviews?**

**A:** We will use 2016 performance reviews as a guideline for awarding 2017 increases.

**Q: Who will participate in this performance review process?**

**A:** Team members hired before October 1, 2016 will complete a Self Review and receive a Manager’s Review. Team members hired on or after October 1, 2016 will participate in the 2017 performance cycle, which will kick-off in April.

**Q: What will performance reviews be based on?**

**A:** Reviews will include three questions that will be rated by both the individual and their manager and two questions focused on recognizing strengths and development opportunities.

Individual Contributor (IC) Self Reviews include these five questions:
1. To what degree did you demonstrate GitLab’s core values?
2. To what degree did you demonstrate the requirements in your job description?
3. Considering your role and the 2016 strategic plan, to what degree did you contribute to your department’s goal?
4. In what areas did you demonstrate the most growth in 2016?
5. Looking forward, in what areas would you most like to develop your knowledge, skills and abilities?

Manager Reviews for ICs include the same five questions and an overall performance summary.

Manager Self Reviews include these six questions:
1. To what degree did you demonstrate GitLab’s core values?
2. To what degree did you demonstrate the requirements in your job description?
3. Considering your role and the 2016 strategic plan, to what degree did you contribute to your department’s goal?
4. Considering the actions below, how effective were you in developing a high performing team? Did you have regularly scheduled feedback meetings with each team member?
Did you facilitate development opportunities, manage performance issues in a timely manner, identify strengths and weaknesses in the team and provide constructive guidance and coaching to team members?
5. In what areas did you demonstrate the most growth in 2016?
6. Looking forward, in what areas would you most like to develop your knowledge, skills and abilities?


Manager reviews for Managers included the same six questions and an overall performance summary.

**Q: How long should the response to each question be?**

**A:** The first three questions in the IC self and manager’s review and the first four questions in manager self and manager’s review require a comment and a rating response. Comments should be to the point and include specific examples which reinforce the selected rating response.  


**Q: What are the rating responses?**

**A:** Ratings options include:
1. Below Expectations
2. Met Expectations
3. Exceeded Expectations
4. Greatly Exceeded Expectations
5. Truly Outstanding

**Q: Do individuals rate their own performance?**

**A:** Yes, both the self review and manager’s review require a rating for performance questions.  The manager’s review also includes an overall performance rating which will factor into the 2017 increase guidelines.

**Q: When are performance reviews due?**

**A:** All reviews must be completed by noon (EST) Monday, March 27, 2017.

**Q: Will we have an opportunity to review and compare self and manager reviews?**

**A:** Yes, managers will receive a copy of self reviews as they are completed. After all manager are finished, we will close the 2016 review cycle and share manager reviews to facilitate open and meaningful dialog around alignment and differences between manager and self reviews. Performance gaps identified should generate productive development conversations.

**Please note:**
An important thing for managers to be looking out for is exceptional or substandard performance.
In cases where you’ve identified a top performer, managers should be on the lookout to find appropriate ways to reward that performance, as well as learn from what makes that person successful and teach that to others.
In cases where below average performance is identified, managers should immediately deliver a PIP to clearly identify performance gaps and expected changes.

**Q: Why link performance to the increase process?**

**A:** Cost of living adjustments (COLA) fund participation, generate mediocrity and lead to the disengagement of high performers while, performance based (merit) increases reward results and motivate continued development and higher achievements.

**Q: When will we hear about 2017 merit increases?**

**A:** After the performance process is complete (March 27th), we will ask managers to weigh in on suggested merit increase guidelines. Management recommendations will then be reviewed by each division executive and the CEO for final approval. If we stick to the established deadlines, we anticipate increases will be effective May 1, 2017.
