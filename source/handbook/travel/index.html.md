## Arranging a visa for travel <a name="arrange-visa"></a>

In some cases when traveling to a conference or summit you might need to arrange a visa to enter that specific country.

Always check the website of the Embassy of the Country you want to visit located in your home country. They will have the most updated information on wether or not you need a visa and what is needed for your application. In some instances you can travel under a visa waiver program (e.g. ESTA) in other you might need to arrange a tourist or business visa. Read their website carefully and ask People Ops if you need any help with acquiring the needed documents for your application.

### Tips & Tricks for visa arrangements <a name="visa-tips"></a>

- Make sure to start in time with your arrangements for a visa. It can take up to 3-4 months to acquire a visa.
- Check if your passport is still valid long enough
- Give priority to arranging your visa, it can take time to get an appointment to apply at the Embassy.
- Double check if you have all needed document and information. Ask People Ops to help you check this if you like.
- Think of the answers you will give during your visa interview; it can influence your visa approval/denial.
- Once the dates for a conference or summit are set start asap with your application if you have needed a special visa in previous situations, just to give yourself enough time and room for errors if they arrise.

#### Booking shows Out of Policy

- Sometimes there is no way around booking a flight or hotel that is out of policy.
- This means that the option selected is more expensive than the cheapest option + our buffer.
- When you try to book this, an email will be sent to travel@gitlab.com for approval.
- Please provide extensive reasoning to make approval easier and faster.
- After 24 hours without any manual action (approved/denied) the booking will automatically be accepted.

### Booking accommodations through Airbnb <a name="airbnb"></a>

- If you need an Airbnb for your stay on a business related trip, you can either book it yourself, or send a request to People Ops.
- For People Ops, please include a link to which airbnb you would like to stay in, the corresponding dates, and the purpose of your travel.
- If you are booking the trip yourself, you may be reimbursed for the portion of your stay that was business related by submitting in Expensify or on your monthly invoice.

### Self Stay Reimbursement Policy <a name="self-stay"></a>

If you decide to stay with friends or family instead of a hotel/Airbnb for a business trip, the company will pay you 50% of what would have been the cost of a reasonable hotel. This is in keeping with our values of frugality and freedom, and intended to reward you for saving company money on accomodation expenses. Please take a screenshot of the hotel search in Egencia and submit this along with your expense report or invoice.

### Expenses While Traveling <a name="expenses-while-traveling"></a>

1. The company will pay for lodging and meals during the part of the trip
that is work-related. Depending on the distance of your travel, this can include
one day before and one day after the work related business. For example, if you
are attending a 3 day conference in a jetlag-inducing location, the company will
cover your lodging and meals those 3 days as well as one day before and one day after.
1. Meals and lodging are covered. The "spend it like it is your own money" rule applies here except
if explicitly noted otherwise. For example, the limits for during the Austin Summit
are detailed on the [Austin Summit page](https://dev.gitlab.org/summit_group_2016/Austin-Summit-2016-project).
1. Always bring a credit card with you when traveling for company business if you have one.
1. Hotels will generally expect you to have a physical credit card to present upon check-in.
This credit card will be kept on file for the duration of your stay. Even if your lodging
was pre-paid by the company or by using a company credit card, the Hotel may still
require a card to be on file for "incidentals".
1. If you incur any work-travel related expenses (on your personal card or a GitLab
company card), please make sure to save the original receipt.
1. When your trip is complete, please file an expense report via Expensify.
Expensify steps can be found http://help.expensify.com/getting-started/

See the section on [Spending Company Money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#spending-company-money)
on the handbook for more details on the expense policies.
