## Booking Travel

The company will cover all work related travel costs.
Few important things to note:

* The company will pay for accommodation and meals during the part of the trip
that is work related. Depending on the distance of your travel, this can include
one day before and one day after the work related business. For example, if you
are attending a 3 day conference in a different timezone, the company will
cover those days as well as one day before and one day after.
* Meals are covered. There is no limit per city or per event. "Spend like it is
your own money" rule applies here.
* The company can accommodate your custom request. It is ok to ask to stay
a few days longer on your trip. However, the extra days will not be covered by
the company.
