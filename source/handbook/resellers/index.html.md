### Closing a deal

The steps to closing a deal are:

1. [Register the deal](#deal-registration)
2. Receive a [quote](gitlab-quote)
3. [Remit payment](paying-gitlab)
4. [Obtain a EULA](signing-the-eula)


### Deal Registration

GitLab requires lead registration. This process is to let us know which deals you are working on so that we can plan accordingly, and also helps prevent channel conflict.

GitLab will not accept an order, give a quote, issue an eval license, nor pay commissions if a deal has not been registered.  


The deal registration form is located at: **MAKE IT LINK TO RESELLER PROJECT**
Please do not share this URL with anyone outside your company.  

When you complete the form, we get notified and will do the following:  

- Check our systems for opportunity approval
- Create an opportunity in our SFDC implementation
- Send a quote to your GitLab@reseller.tld email address  
*Note: this is a reseller quote; not to be shared with the customer*
- Send an evaluation license to GitLab@reseller.tld email address
- Send you an email with any other intelligence that we may have on this account; possibly including:
   - GitLab CE usage (if any) from [GitLab Version Check](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales-process/version_check/).
   - Other usage elsewhere at that company and their affiliates
   - Contact details of the GitLab sales rep that has been working with that company in the past (if any)
   - Our SFDC opportunity name (in case you need to reference it to us)


### Email to SFDC

At GitLab, we regularly review our leads for activity. In order to  make that **way** less painful than asking you to fill out a spreadsheet, or sit through a long phone call; we will enable mailto SFDC for your email accounts that will be interacting with GitLab leads.

#### To use

When replying to leads,  BCC this address: **MAKE THIS LINK TO RESELLER PROJECT**

This will create an activity record on the contact, lead, account, and opportunity records that match the people on the to: and cc: lines.   

This will show up on the Lead Activity report, and make everyone happy that the leads we are referring to you are showing activity.

When SFDC communities are eventually turned on, you will be able to see all of this activity too.  

If there are any additional email addresses you want me to enable SFDC to receive email from, please let me know
