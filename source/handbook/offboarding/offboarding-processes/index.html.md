### Returning property to GitLab
{: #returning-property}

As part of [offboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/offboarding/), any GitLab property needs to be returned to GitLab. GitLab will pay for the shipping either by People Ops sending a FedEx shipping slip or it can be returned by another mutually agreed method. If property is not returned, GitLab reserves the right to use a creditor company to help retrieve the property.

#### FedEx info for the team member

Pull up the departing contributors home address. Find a Fedex location close to them. Then follow the template below.

"Hi [Name of team member]

The closest Fedex to you is located on [full street address, city, state, zip code]. Driving or walking directions can be found here: [enter link from “mapping home location to the Fedex location”]

Once there you can use Fedex boxes that you need and do the following actions:

1. Package the equipment in the box
2. Send package to GitLab HQ in San Francisco
3. Mark on the invoice "Bill Recipient"
4. Our Fedex number is: [find the number in Secretarial Vault in 1Password]
5. Provide People Ops the tracking number via email

Please let People Ops know if you have any questions."
