title: "GitLab Offboarding"
---

Before starting an offboarding issue, make sure that the team member's resignation or termination has been discussed and cleared with _at least_ the member of the executive team to whom the team member (in)directly reports. For [involuntary terminations](/handbook/people-operations/#involuntary-terminations), make yourself familiar with the guidelines in the People Operations handbook.

When it is time for offboarding, create issue for former team member on the dev server in the [organization issue tracker](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues/), and add the following checklist (edit it for applicability to the individual). This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue. When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.


```
1. [ ] People Ops: Once the termination has taken place (whether voluntary or involuntary), as soon as possible, create issue called 'Offboarding (NAME), per (DATE)' in [organization](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues) with relevant lines of the master offboarding checklist and /cc @abby, @brittany, @joan.
1. [ ] For this offboarding, the manager is @MENTION, People Ops is handled by @MENTION.
1. [x] _not relevant_ People Ops: Send an email to the chosen buddy letting them know that they have been chosen and include a link to the onboarding issue.

Also change the phone number and alternative email (typically personal email address) that are associated with the account. Switch 2FA back on and save login credentials in 1password (PeopleOps vault). When asked for a phone number use your own, this is only for the purposes of turning 2FA back on.
   1. [ ] People Ops: upon manager's request (typically 4 weeks after blocking
     the Google account), transfer owned documents from Google Drive to
   manager, and delete the Google account. (automatically disables Drive access)
