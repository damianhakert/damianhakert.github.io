## Community Writers Program - Terms and Conditions

For an overview, please check the [Community Writers Program](../) webpage.

### Purposes of the Program

The Community Writers program has the purpose of producing high-quality resources to facilitate:

- the use of GitLab as a fully integrated software development platform
- the use of GitLab as [Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Development](/2016/08/05/continuous-integration-delivery-and-deployment-with-gitlab/) platform
- GitLab usability for specific use cases
- in-depth exploration of GitLab's [features](/features/) and capabilities
- the use of GitLab Documentation as a source of developer-related resources
- the search through technical content for GitLab users (in the documentation website)

### Publishing Technical Articles

[Technical Articles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/writing_documentation.html#technical-articles)
live in the [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com) website.
To guarantee that we maintain high quality and high accuracy, every piece of content
is submitted to review and approval from the Community Writers Lead, or, in their absence, from
one of the technical writers at GitLab.

### Program Manager

The Community Writers Program is part of the [Technical Writing](../../) Team at GitLab.
[Marcia Ramos](/team/#XMDRamos), the **Community Writers Lead**, manages the program.

Our technical writers are also experienced editors, who will provide authors with feedback,
proofreading, and copyediting.

### Requirements

- Writers should have excellent written skills and have previous experience
in writing technical content, which needs to be clear, correct, concise,
trustful, well structured, and easy to follow along.
- Writers should have excellent written English skills.
- Writers should be skilled in writing in markdown and being able to structure
their files without further assistance.
- Writers should be active users of Git **and** GitLab, and must have a user
account on GitLab.com.
- Writers should be fully capable of creating their own content and presenting
it ready for publishing. We will not consider content that needs extensive reviews to get ready.
- Writers should integrally domain the process they're willing to write about.
We will not help writers with their procedure, as they are expected to fully
domain them before willing to join this Program.
- Writers should read all the guidelines and respect them entirely. We will not
consider for reviews articles that don't respect them.
- Writers should accept the review and avoid confronting the reviewer endlessly;
do it only when strictly necessary. Reviewers are there to help to refine the content,
not to argue with the author about every little sentence. Editors are skilled
professionals and will work for making a better content, ensuring it has the quality
standards required by GitLab.
- Content must be original, comprehensible, technical, and unprecedented.

### Ineligibility

Are considered **ineligible** for the Community Writers Program if:

- You're a GitLab Team member.
- If you intent to promote your own product, company, or the company you work for. In this case, you might be eligible for a [Guest Blog Post](/handbook/marketing/blog/#guest-posts).
- If you don't fulfill the requirements above.

### Content Evaluation

#### Evaluation Criteria

The content will be evaluated based on:

- Readability
- Flow
- Structure
- Grammar
- Complexity
- Accuracy
- Respects the Style Guidelines
- Respects the Writing Method

#### Topic and Pre-assessment

- Writers choose one of the existing issues or create new ones in the
[Technical Articles](https://gitlab.com/gl-docsteam/technical-articles/issues)
issue tracker. **Pick only one issue at a time**.
- Writers propose the [outlines](../../#3rd-plan) of their articles in the issue thread,
together with a writing sample, and the introduction of their article. Once you've
gathered all of this, drop a line to let us know you're willing to write about that:
    
    ```md
    @marcia I would like to write about this subject and I accept the
    [terms](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/technical-writing/community-writers/terms-and-conditions/)
    of the Community Writers Program.
    ```

- The editor evaluates the outlines, the writing sample and the introduction in the issue thread.
- Based on this review, the editor might approve or reprove the author to write.
- If approved, the author is free to write the content and send us the first draft. In this
case, the editor will drop a line in the issue:

    ```md
    @user, you got it! Please write your draft in markdown, and send it via email
    in the email body. We do not open any attachments.
    ```

**Note:** if you just comment in the issue and don't provide us with a writing
sample and the introduction of the article, we will not respond to your comment.
{:.note}

#### Draft

- Writers should write based on the [Writing Method](../../#writing-method) and
[Style Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/doc_styleguide.html)
- Writers should send us the first draft written in **markdown** via email to `marcia@gitlab.com`,
with the content **in the email body**. We will not open any attachments.
- We will respond as soon as we can, accepting or rejecting the proposal
according to the evaluation criteria.
- If we reject the content, we can give the author one chance to make it
better, or reject it entirely.
- If we accept the content, we will provide feedback on what needs to be improved.
- Once accomplished, we will require the author to submit a merge request
to [GitLab CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/) or
[GitLab EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/) repositories.
See the [Writing Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/writing_documentation.html)
section for further instructions.

#### Review and Publish

- Once in the merge request, the editors will proceed with the final review:
they may ask for the author to make adjustments, or they can copyedit themselves.
- Once approved, the merge request will be merged, and the article will be
published on the GitLab Documentation website.

### Compensation Criteria

Once you get approved to submit your content in a merge request, we will inform you
about the compensation range your article is eligible to. If you agree with
compensation offered, you can submit the merge request.

The offer will be based on the complexity and knowledge level of your content:

- Simple // Beginner: **$50** to **$100**
- Intermediary // Intermediate: **$100** to **$150**
- Complex // Advanced: **$150** to **$200**

The overall evaluation is based on these criteria, but the reviewer will
consider your article as a whole to define the compensation offer.

The amount is expressed in American Dollars (USD).

### Content Ownership

- Once in a merge request, the ownership of that content is GitLab's.
The author cannot publish that content somewhere else.
- Once the article gets published by GitLab, the author is welcome to
reproduce the content in their own blog, or somewhere else, as long as
they provide attribution:

    ```
    This article was [originally published](link-to-article) by [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com).
    ```

- The content can be also partially reproduced, as long as given
attribution to GitLab and linked directly to the original article.

Once the content is published, GitLab reserves the right to change,
rewrite, update, and remove the content totally, at GitLab's will.

#### Updates

If the content gets outdated, we will ask the author to update.
If it doesn't happen, GitLab reserves the right to update it, rewrite it
(subjected to authorship updates), or remove it entirely.

### Time Frame

We expect to have your content published up to one month after the beginning of
the process. It can be faster than that, or slower, depending on the actual demand of
work from the editors, and on the quality of your content.

### Payment

When your post gets published, send us an invoice. We will provide you with a template for this document.
GitLab will pay you in American Dollars (USD) from a bank account in the USA, via wired transfer
to your bank account.

### Important Notes

- If you want to write about your own product (or the product you represent),
and how it integrates with GitLab, we'll be happy to have you as a
[Guest Writer](/handbook/marketing/blog/#guest-posts). The Community Writers Program won't apply for these cases.
- You are encouraged to write more than one article. If you succeed on
the first process, we'll invite you to write for us regularly.
The process for writing more than one post is exactly the same for
writing the first one. Please, pick up an issue at a time.
- The terms and conditions presented by this document are subject to
change without previous notice.
