                    We need you to create content based on your experience, not the opposite. If you have figured out something amazing to do with GitLab, or from GitLab, and if there's no content on that among GitLab's resources, we would love to publish your tutorial or guide.

                    If you're unsure about how to do what you're willing to write about, we urge you to figure it out first.
