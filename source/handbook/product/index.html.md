## Goals of Product

Everyone at GitLab is involved with the product. It's the reason why we are
working together.

goals.

1. Improve GitLab's existing tools.
1. Achieve [our vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision) of a
complete toolset.
1. Make our product more interesting for our customers through Products and
EE exclusive features.

## Product at GitLab

GitLab is designed and developed in a unique way.

The direction for the GitLab product is spelled out on the
[Direction page](/direction). This document provides lessons and heuristics on
how to design changes and new features.

### TL;DR

1. [Minimally Viable Change](#the-minimally-viable-change): Work in iterations
by implementing only the minimally viable change.
1. [Convention over Configuration](#convention-over-configuration): Avoid
configuration and make it work out of the box.
1. [Be Ambitious](#be-ambitious): do things no one else is doing.
1. [Do not mess with Flow](#do-not-mess-with-flow): _frictionless_ from idea to
production. Avoid adding clicks.

### Product Core Values

#### The Minimally Viable Change

Reduce every change proposal to its very minimally viable form.
This allows us to ship almost anything within a single release,
get immediate feedback and avoid deep investments in ideas that might
not work. Other advantages:

- This helps avoiding the sunk-cost fallacy in situations where we might
decide to drop a change, as we almost never spend more than a few weeks working
on something.
- It prevents over-engineering.
- It forces everyone involved to look for the most simple solution to a problem,
which is often the superior solution.
- It forces working towards an 80/20 solution, where competing products might cater
to the last 20% of the market, a minimally viable solution is _good enough_ for 80%.
- Further changes or enhancements to the change are driven by feedback from
actual users. This is a much more informative mechanism than the intuition
of a product person (though note that this doesn't mean we should just build
whatever feedback tells us).

#### Convention over Configuration

Prefer choices that are well thought out, based on current best practices.
Avoid unnecessary configuration.

For example, when considering adding a checkbox or two radio boxes, think really
hard what users really want. Most of the time, you'll find you really only need
one solution, so remove the option. When two possible choices really are
necessary, the best or most common one should be default, and the other one
should be possible. If the non-default choices are significantly less common,
then consider taking them out of the main workflow for making decisions such as
putting them behind an Advanced configuration tab.

Every configuration in GitLab multiplies its complexity, which means
the application is harder to use, harder to develop, and
less friendly to its users.

Making features configurable is _easy_ and _lazy_.
It's a natural reaction to propose a big change to be configurable,
as you worry it'll negatively affect certain users. However,
by making a feature configurable, you've now created two problems.

![](/handbook/product/p2.png)

Work on solutions that work for everyone, that replace all
previous solutions.

Sometimes configuration is inevitable or preferable. GitLab should
work perfectly right out of the box for most users. Your configuration
can't make that experience worse and should always _get out of the
way of the user_.

#### Be Ambitious

Many crazy, over-ambitious ideas just sound like they are impossible
because no one else is doing them.

Because we have amazing engineers and a culture of shipping a minimally
viable change, we are able to do a lot more 'impossible' things than other
people.

That's why we're shipping merge conflict resolution, why we shipped built-in CI
before anyone else did it, why we built a better static pages solution, and why
we're able to compete.

![](/handbook/product/p3.png)

#### Do not mess with Flow

Doing something simple in GitLab should be simple and require no
human cpu-cycles to do so. Things that are simple now, should
be simple in two and ten years.

This sounds obvious, but messing with Flow is easily done. In most
cases, flow is disrupted by adding another action, another click.

For instance: You want users to be made aware of the rules of a project.
Your proposal is a little popup that shows the rules before they create an
issue. This means that every time that someone creates an issue they need
to click once before resuming their normal action. This is unacceptable.
A better solution is to add a link to the issue that points the user to this.

![](/handbook/product/p4.png)

It's very hard to maintain flow with a lot of configurations and options.
In cases where you want to enforce certain behaviour, the most obvious step
is to add another step or action. This can be avoided by making the action
work in parallel (like a link in the issue), encouraging rather than enforcing
certain behaviours.

We don't want users to be able to construct workflows that break GitLab or
make it work in unpredictable ways.

## Alignment

Balancing our great ambition with our dedication to customer success is tough. Add in a growing number of dedicated teams focusing on areas of the product, and it becomes challenging to make sure everything we work on is truly the right thing to work on, right now. To help with that, it's good to keep a few things in mind. To ask a few questions to keep us all aligned.

At a high level, you can think of aligning along these dimensions (not necessarily in priority order):

* Align with company top projects
* Align with company vision
* Align with business objectives (profit, i.e. EE)
* Align with team/project vision
* Align with team/project top priorities
* Align with developer experience
* Align with customer demands

To make it concrete with an example, the CI/CD team might ask:

* What else is needed for the idea-to-production vision? Are there other APIs needed for ChatOps integration? Can we trigger manual actions via API? [Environment-specific variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20367), [activity](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19992)
* What moves us towards automatic deploys of `gitlab-ce`?
* What moves the [CI/CD vision](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/cicd/) forward?
* Can we polish the existing feature set? (e.g. [#21126](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21126), [#18178](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/18178), [Show builds in context of pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20863), [#5983](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/5983), [#3976](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/3976))
* Can we speed up CI/CD pipelines? (e.g. sticky runners, [automatic parallelization](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21480))
* What can we do to make customers happy? ([list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues?scope=all&state=opened&utf8=âœ“&label_name%5B%5D=CI&label_name%5B%5D=customer))
* What can we do to ship EE features for CI? (e.g. [gitlab-org/gitlab-ee#933](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/933))

>>>>>>> Add responsabilities and how we work sections
### Responsibilities of a Product Manager

As a Product Manager, you are expected to act as the reference for everything
related to your area of responsibilities.

Everyone has opinions about the product, and all opinions matter and must be
heard. Our great company culture empowers any employee to take decisions
regarding existing or upcoming features. However when it's time to make a
decision regarding the direction of the product, it's your responsibility as
Product Manager to take the lead.

Your other responsibilities, and also what you are not responsible about, are
listed in [the job description](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/product-manager/).

### Workflow

Almost everything that we do is documented in an issue. Issues are how GitLab
works. Every feature, bug, feedback is documented and processed.

#### How to submit a new issue

1. The first thing you should do is searching both CE and EE projects if a
similar issue already exists. There is no need to create duplicates.
2. Identify if the issue is about GitLab Community Edition (EE) or GitLab
Enterprise Edition (EE).
3. You should clearly state what the current pain point is, what we are trying
to solve, what the benefits will be, what it should do, how to accomplish that
and the next steps.
4. Choose which labels is relevant to the issue. If you are unsure about what
certain labels are for, head up to the Labels page ([CE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/labels)
or [EE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/labels)) and read the
descriptions.
5. Unless you know what you are doing, do not
    - assign someone to the issue
    - assign a milestone
    - set a due date
    - add weight - weight represents the technical complexity and should be
    defined by our developers
6. Mention the different stakeholders in the body of your issue. In most product
related issues, we usually mention the product team members, either the frontend
or the backend lead and sometimes the cofounders, as what we do impact the
product most of the time. Mentioning the people in the body issue will
trigger the notification mechanisms chosen by the people who are mentioned -
therefore there is no need to notify people in another channel after the issue
has been created (Slack, email).

#### Wireframes

When relevant, you can include a wireframe in your issues in order to illustrate
your point. You don't need to include wireframes per se - our UX/design team can
help us on that matter. Simply ping them if you need their help. We like
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for its simplicity and its sketch-y approach.
If you don't have inspiration, you can also paste screenshots of similar
features in other products.

#### What is a Meta issue?

Meta is a label assigned to certain issues that contain a large list of todos.
If you are familiar with the Agile methodology, it's similar to an epic. At
GitLab we have a short release cycle: the 22nd of every month. In some cases we
won't be able to tackle all the tasks of a meta issue - this is why we centralize
all the things that we need to do in a meta issue, then break it down to smaller
issues. Meta issues are usually big, have lots of comments and passionate
discussions and always lead to something great.

#### Which issue should you be working on?

When you don't have specific tasks assigned, you should work on issues that are
labeled `Product work`, in both EE and CE projects. These are issues that need our
love and attention the most.

### Where should you look when you need help?

* The first things you should read are this handbook as well as the [general
handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
* You can ask questions related to Product in the `#product` Slack channel.
* General questions should be asked in `#questions`.
* Specific Git related questions should be asked in `#git-help`.
* HR questions should be asked in `#peopleops`.

### Shipping

#### Internal and external evangelization

Before shipping a new or updated feature, you are responsible for its
evangelization, both internally and externally. When something is released, the
following teams need to be aware of it as they will all need to do something
about it:
* marketing: depending on the importance of the feature, we need the help of
marketing to promote this feature on our different communication channels.
* sales: sales need to know what's new or changed in the product so they can
have better arguments to convince new or existing customers during their sales
process.
* support: as they are in contact with our users and customers all day long,
support should perfectly know how our products work.

The best way to achieve that is to schedule meetings with the different teams in
order to prepare the launch.

#### GitLab University

To promote a major new feature internally, you can ask to host a GitLab
University, a company wide demo session. This is a great opportunity to make
sure every one is on the same page.

# How to work as a PM

If you follow the guidelines above, you won't be writing long, detailed
specs for a part of the product for the next year. So how should you be
spending your time?

Invest the majority of your time in understanding the problem deeply (say 70%).
Then spend 10% of your time writing the spec _for only the first iteration_ and
handling comments, while the remaining 20% you work on promoting it.

A problem you understand well will always have a (seemingly) simple or obvious
solution. Reduce it to its simplest form (see above) and only ship that.

Once you've shipped your solution, both you and the community will
have a much better idea on what can be improved and what should be prioritized
for future iterations.

As a PM you're the person that has to kick-off new initiatives. You're not
responsible for shipping something on time, but you are responsible for taking
action and setting the direction. Be active everywhere, over-communicate and
sell the things you think are important to the rest of the team and community.

As a PM you don't own the product: ask other people for feedback and give
team members and the community the space to suggest and create without your
direct intervention. It's your job to make sure something is decided and
planned, not to come up with every idea or change.
