Awesome! You're about to become a GitLab UX Researcher!
Make sure you've checked out our [handbook](/handbook) beforehand, so you get a feeling
of how we work at GitLab. Below you'll find everything you need to get started.
If something is missing, add it (as goes with everything at GitLab)!

## GitLab Instances

We have two main GitLab instances, as explained in the
[general onboarding](/handbook/general-onboarding#gitlab-instances).

## Workflow

1. Work with the UX team to determine the question to research.
2. Create an issue to track the work. The issue should include the question to be researched, the hypothesis, what the impact will be based on how the question is answered, and what research method will be used. List related issues.
3. Tag the issue with 'UX Research'.
4. Conduct the research and document the findings and recommendations in the issue.
5. Assign the issue to the UX Designer who is going to implement the design based on the research. Remove the 'UX Research' tag and add the 'UX' tag.

## Issues

As design can be subjective, discussion can heat up. Always try to be [direct](/handbook/#directness), but [kind](/handbook/#kindness). Try to give your best reasoning for your choices and evaluate everyone's opinions. Come up with a solution instead of discussing endlessly. If you think additional perspective is needed, mention a fellow UX Designer in the issue.
