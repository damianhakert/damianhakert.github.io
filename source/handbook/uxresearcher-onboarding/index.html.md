## GitLab Instances

We have two main GitLab instances, as explained in the
[general onboarding](/handbook/general-onboarding#gitlab-instances).

## Workflow

1. Work with the UX team to determine the question to research.
2. Create an issue to track the work. The issue should include the question to be researched, the hypothesis, what the impact will be based on how the question is answered, and what research method(s) will be used. List related issues.
3. Tag the issue with 'UX Research' and assign it to yourself.
4. Conduct the research and document the findings and recommendations in the issue.
5. Assign the issue to the UX Designer who is going to implement the design based on the research. Remove the 'UX Research' tag and add the 'UX' tag.

## Research methods

The methods and techniques used by the UX team vary on the type of questions trying to be answered.

### Quantitative

#### A/B Testing
TODO

#### Instrumentation
TODO

### Qualitative

#### Contextual inquiry / User Acceptance Testing
This method is used to understand the current (or potential) customers, use cases, and scenarios for the features. It involves interviewing people, and synthesizing the information into models such as personals and journey maps. These models are then shared to help inform decisions.

#### Usability testing
Usability testing is used to understand if the details of the flow and design interactions make sense. Users are observed as they are asked to complete tasks, thinking aloud and sharing their understanding of the experience. 

#### Concept validation
Concept validation is used to ensure new features are the right features needed by our customers to solve their existing problems.
