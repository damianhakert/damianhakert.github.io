## GitLab Instances

We have two main GitLab instances, as explained in the
[general onboarding](/handbook/general-onboarding#gitlab-instances).

## Workflow

1. Work with the UX team to determine the question to research.
2. Create an issue to track the work. The issue should include the question to be researched, the hypothesis, what the impact will be based on how the question is answered, and what research method(s) will be used. List related issues.
3. Tag the issue with 'UX Research' and assign it to yourself.
4. Conduct the research and document the findings and recommendations in the issue.
5. Assign the issue to the UX Designer who is going to implement the design based on the research. Remove the 'UX Research' tag and add the 'UX' tag.
