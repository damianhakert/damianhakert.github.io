## Vacancy creation process<a name="vacancy-creation-process"></a>

1. Create job description.
    * The CEO needs to authorize any new job positions/searches, and agree on the proposed hiring team.
    * The description is made through [Workable](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend)
    which also populates the [Jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs). The description consists of:
      * Job title
      * Preferred timezone where candidate should reside
      * Description of role, and/or link to Job Description page on GitLab website. (For example for a [Developer](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/developer) )
      * Requirements for the role (can be split into must-have’s and nice-to-have’s)
      * Post-amble stating how to apply, and who the hiring manager is.
1. Define hiring team.
    * Roles can be assigned fluidly, depending on who is available, but the following roles need
    to be thought through ahead of time: (one person can of course handle multiple roles)
      * Person(s) to do first vetting of candidates, selecting applicants for interview.
      * Person(s) to have (first round) interviews.
      * Optional: Person(s) to have second round interviews.
      * Person(s) to make final decision to make offer. This step always involves the CEO.
      * Person(s) actually making the offer, including terms of offer.
      * Person(s) to handle communications with applicants along the way.
1. Hiring team agrees on a hiring timeline. Typical options:
    * Choose from specific deadlines (e.g. all applicants will be reviewed on date X, hear back by date Y), or
    * Choose rolling application process, wherein the review and interview process  happen as applications come in, or
    * Some combination of the above. So for example, wait for X amount of time
    to gather enough applications, then review in bulk, set up first interviews,
    and repeat this process until a suitable applicant is found.
1. Publish the job description through the [Workable](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend) interface.
    * Confirm that the CEO (or person authorized by CEO) has signed off on the description, and hiring team.
1. Optional: advertise the job description.
    * This can be through “soft” referral, e.g. all GitLab staff post link to jobs site on their LinkedIn profiles.
    * Tweet the new job posting.
    * Consider advertising and/or listing on paid / free job boards.
    * Use the [Workable Clipper](http://resources.workable.com/the-workable-clipper) to help source candidates directly from LinkedIn, and  familiarize yourself with the Workable environment, work flow, features, and support desk.

## Hiring Process<a name="hiring-process"></a>

1. Confirm application: applicants should receive confirmation of their application, thanking them for submitting their information. This is an automated message from Workable. If the person came though another channel please add them to Workable before continuing the process. TODO How to do this.
1. Ask more information if needed: if information is missing and the applicant seems sufficiently promising (or not enough information to be able to make that determination), the appropriate person from the hiring team should follow up requesting additional information.
1. Screening call:
1. Technical interview (optional): As described on the [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page, certain positions
require [technical interviews](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/#technical-interview).
1. Manager interview (see below for questions)
1. C-level executive interview (if different than the manager)
1. CEO Interview (see below for questions)
1. Make an offer (the CEO needs to authorize offers)
1. Ensure that offer is accepted
1. [Prepare contracts](#prep-contracts)
1. Ensure that the contract is signed
1. [Start onboarding](#move-to-onboarding)

At any time during this process the candicate can be rejected.
If so please use the message TODO
If the candicate asks for feedback always offer frank feedback.
This is hard but it is part of our company values.

## Screening call

This call is done by our [adminstrative coordinator](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/administrative-coordinator/).

Questions are:

1. Why are they looking for a new job?
1. What is your experience with X? (do for each of the skills asked in the job description)
1. How do they feel about working remotely and do they have experience with it?
1. Compensation expectation and compensation in current/last job.

At the end of the screening call applicant should be told what the timeline is for what the next steps are (if any).
An example message would be "We are reviewing applications through the end of next week, and will let you know by the end of two weeks from today whether you've been selected for the next round or not. Please feel free to ping us if you haven't heard anything from us by then."
