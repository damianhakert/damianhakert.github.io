## Vacancy Creation Process<a name="vacancy-creation-process"></a>

The CEO needs to authorize any new job positions/searches, and agree on the proposed hiring team.

1. Define hiring team. Roles can be assigned fluidly (see below for the [Hiring Process](#hiring-process)), depending on who is available, bearing in
mind that the most time consuming aspect tends to be review of the first wave of applicants.
1. Create the job description on our website, and in Workable
    1. Create the relevant page in `https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/[name-of-job]`
    1. Add a job of the exact same job title on [Workable](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend)
       * For location, select "Telecommute".
       * For the description, simply write `For the job description, see [url of relevant jobs page on GitLab's website]`
       * Indicate what applicants need to provide with their application. By default, this will include their resumé, a cover letter, but it may also
       include qualifying questions such as "What timezone are you in?" and "Are you aware that this is not a DevOps role?".
       * "Publish" the job, and follow the links to the application form.
    1. Embed the link to the application form for the new job on our [Jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/)
1. Optional: advertise the job description.
    * This can be through “soft” referral, e.g. all GitLab staff post link to jobs site on their LinkedIn profiles.
    * Tweet the new job posting.
    * Consider advertising and/or listing on paid / free job boards.
    * Use the [Workable Clipper](http://resources.workable.com/the-workable-clipper) to help source candidates directly from LinkedIn, and  familiarize yourself with the Workable environment, work flow, features, and support desk.

## Hiring Process<a name="hiring-process"></a>

1. Confirm application: applicants automatically receive confirmation of their application, thanking them for submitting their information. This is an automated message from Workable. If the person came though another channel please add them to Workable before continuing the process. There are various ways to do this, see [Workable's documentation](https://resources.workable.com/adding-candidates).
1. Ask more information if needed: if information is missing and the applicant seems sufficiently promising (or not enough information to be able to make that determination), the appropriate person from the hiring team should follow up requesting additional information.
1. Hiring manager does a first round of rejections. Disqualified candidates should be sent a note informing them of the rejection. There are templates in Workable to assist, but messages can be tailored as appropriate: place yourself in the receiving end of the message.
1. [Screening call](#screening-call) (optional, see below for further detail).
1. Technical interview (optional): As described on the [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page, certain positions
require [technical interviews](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/#technical-interview).
1. Manager interview (see below for questions)
1. C-level executive interview (if different than the manager, see below for questions)
1. CEO interview (if different than the C-level executive, see below for questions)
1. Make a verbal or written (email) offer (the CEO needs to authorize offers)
1. Hiring manager follows up to ensure that the offer is accepted, and then moves to [preparing contracts](#prep-contracts)
1. Hiring manager ensures that the contract is signed, and [starts the onboarding process](#move-to-onboarding) (the People Ops team can help).

Some further guidelines around the hiring process:

- For female candidates, include at least one interview with a female GitLab team member.
- At any time during this process the applicant can be rejected (and should always be notified of this).
- If the applicant asks for further feedback always offer frank feedback. This is hard, but it is part of our company values.

## Screening Call<a name="screening-call"></a>

For some positions, we conduct screening calls. This call is typically done by our [administrative coordinator](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/administrative-coordinator/).

Questions are:

1. Why are they looking for a new job?
1. What is your experience with X? (do for each of the skills asked in the job description)
1. How do they feel about working remotely and do they have experience with it?
1. Compensation expectation and compensation in current/last job.

[An example of the output of a good screening call](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend/jobs/128446/browser/applied/candidate/7604850) (need workable account).

At the end of the screening call applicant should be told what the timeline is for what the next steps are (if any).
An example message would be "We are reviewing applications through the end of next week, and will let you know by the end of two weeks from today whether you've been selected for the next round or not. Please feel free to ping us if you haven't heard anything from us by then."

## Getting Contracts Ready, Reviewed, and Signed<a name="prep-contracts"></a>

Offers made to new team members should be documented in the email thread between the
person authorized to make the offer (e.g. CEO) and the applicant.

1. Email example: "We would love to have you as part of our team. You will have
a position of [job title]. As a contractor you will invoice [monthly rate] per month.
You will report to the [manager]. We proposed to make you eligible for [number] of stock options.
We will send you a contract on Monday based on
the examples on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/. If you have not
received anything on that day please reply-to-all to let us know. Please let us
know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime."
1. In the email confirmation of the offer,
put the People Operations email alias (which can be found in the "GitLab Email Forwarding" google doc) in the cc.
1. One person from People Operations will reply-to-all to everyone in the thread
(including the applicant) to confirm that they will make the contract. Speed matters: if you are in People Operations and you can
tackle this, then raise your hand and hit reply-all.
   - For any hires for which the COO does _not_ sign, the COO reviews the contract
after which it can be sent out to be signed by any of the relevant C-level team
members. For any hires for which the COO should sign, either the CFO or the CEO must
review the contracts.
1. This person from People Operations makes the contract based on the details found in the Workable
platform, and uses reply-all to gather any missing pieces of information, and to
confirm with a reply-to-all when the contract is sent. Note: the number of proposed stock options
must always be mentioned specifically, even when it is 0. People Ops must follow-up
with the person who requested the contract to make sure that this point is addressed.
1. This same person from People Operations files the signed contract in the appropriate place, and starts the [**onboarding issue**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-onboarding/).

Note for People Operations:
- the type of contract required (employee or contractor; BV or Inc) is clarified by the guideline on the
[Contracts page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts).
- Onboarding info for the PeopleOps system, BambooHR, can be found on the [PeopleOps](about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations) page.
