## Hiring Process<a name="hiring-process"></a>

1. Create job description.
    * The CEO needs to authorize any new job positions/searches, and agree on the proposed hiring team.
    * The description is made through [Workable](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend)
    which also populates the [Jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs). The description consists of:
      * Job title
      * Preferred timezone where candidate should reside
      * Description of role, and/or link to Job Description page on GitLab website. (For example for a [Developer](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/developer) )
      * Requirements for the role (can be split into must-have’s and nice-to-have’s)
      * Post-amble stating how to apply, and who the hiring manager is.
1. Define hiring team.
    * Roles can be assigned fluidly, depending on who is available, but the following roles need
    to be thought through ahead of time: (one person can of course handle multiple roles)
      * Person(s) to do first vetting of candidates, selecting applicants for interview.
      * Person(s) to have (first round) interviews.
      * Optional: Person(s) to have second round interviews.
      * Person(s) to make final decision to make offer. This step always involves the CEO.
      * Person(s) actually making the offer, including terms of offer.
      * Person(s) to handle communications with applicants along the way.
1. Hiring team agrees on a hiring timeline. Typical options:
    * Choose from specific deadlines (e.g. all applicants will be reviewed on date X, hear back by date Y), or
    * Choose rolling application process, wherein the review and interview process  happen as applications come in, or
    * Some combination of the above. So for example, wait for X amount of time
    to gather enough applications, then review in bulk, set up first interviews,
    and repeat this process until a suitable applicant is found.
1. Publish the job description through the [Workable](https://gitlab.workable.com/backend) interface.
    * Confirm that the CEO (or person authorized by CEO) has signed off on the description, and hiring team.
1. Optional: advertise the job description.
    * This can be through “soft” referral, e.g. all GitLab staff post link to jobs site on their LinkedIn profiles.
    * Tweet the new job posting.
    * Consider advertising and/or listing on paid / free job boards.
    * Use the [Workable Clipper](http://resources.workable.com/the-workable-clipper) to help source candidates directly from LinkedIn, and  familiarize yourself with the Workable environment, work flow, features, and support desk.
1. Interview Questions.
    * Hiring team to determine which questions need to be asked, and by whom in the team, for a list that the CEO tends to ask see below.
    * Homework assignments may be required for some positions.
1. Communication with Applicants
    * Upon receiving the application and reviewing it for the first time:
      * Applicants should receive confirmation of their application, thanking
      them for submitting their information. This may be an automated message.
      * If information is missing and the applicant seems sufficiently promising
      (or not enough information to be able to make that determination), the appropriate person from the hiring team should follow up requesting additional information.
    * Timing
      * Interviews should be set up in accordance with the hiring timeline that
      was defined previously; and applicants should be notified of this process as much as possible.
      * At time of interview, applicant should be told what the timeline is for
      a decision, and what the next steps are (if any). An example message would
      be "We are reviewing applications through the end of next week, and will let
      you know by the end of two weeks from today whether you've been selected for
      the next round or not. Please feel free to ping us if you haven't heard anything from us by then."
    * Feedback
      * Do not hesitate to involve the CEO in reviewing feedback to candidates who have not been selected.
1. Make a decision, make an offer.
    * The CEO needs to authorize offers.
    * Sign up successful applicant and move to [onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-onboarding).
    * Inform other applicants that we selected someone else this time. Applicants remain in the database and may be contacted in the future for other roles.
