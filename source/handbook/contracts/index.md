## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>
These agreements are examples of the agreements that we currently use at GitLab. However, the terms and conditions of  an employee or 
contractor’s agreement will vary based on each employee or contractor’s specific circumstances. GitLab reserves the right to amend or 
change the sample agreements, as well as each employee or contractor’s actual agreement. The samples below are samples only — they are not 
valid as such and do not replace personalized signed agreements.

## How to use this page to prepare a contract <a name="how-to-use"></a>
Assuming that the [hiring process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/) went smoothly, now it is time to prepare the applicable contracts. 
The following set of steps should suffice:

1. Copy the relevant contracts to a single Word or Google Doc (Word does a better job of retaining formatting). 
  * NOTE: Remember that regardless of the status of the new team member, i.e. contractor or employee for either GitLab Inc., or GitLab BV, 
  a PIAA must be included with the contract.
  * Further formatting tips once it is in Word:
     * select all, and 
        * decrease font size a few times until everything looks more reasonable. The main headers need to be adjusted further to fit on a single line.
        * set line spacing to 1.0
        * add space after paragraphs
     * Insert page breaks for Signature pages and Exhibits, and between contract and PIAA.
1. Find all fields with curly brackets (` { } `), and edit as appropriate. It is often efficient 
to do a find + replace on fields that appear multiple times such as names, email 
addresses, etc. (fields are named the same in the contracts / PIAA to make this easier).
1. When removing optional clauses, take care that the paragraph / section numbering still makes sense (especially for the GitLab Inc offer letter).
1. Save newly created contract + PIAA (or offer letter + PIAA), and process via HelloSign (also see [how to get legal documents signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) ).

In the event that Contributor gives notice of termination during the performance of the Statement of Work, the terms of the Agreement will govern completion, acceptance and payment by GitLab for any work product.  

**8.2 Return of Materials**. Following any notice of termination of this Agreement given pursuant to Section 8.1 or upon expiration of the term of this Agreement, Contributor will fully cooperate with GitLab in all matters relating to the winding up of Contributor’s pending work on behalf of GitLab and the orderly transfer of any work or documents to GitLab.

Contributor’s relationship with GitLab will be that of an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship.

Contributor will not be entitled to any of the benefits which GitLab may make available to its employees, including, but not limited to, group insurance, stock option plans, profit-sharing or retirement benefits. For US-based contractors, GitLab will regularly report amounts paid to Contributor by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by law. Because Contributor is an independent contractor, GitLab will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain worker’s compensation insurance on Contributor’s behalf. Contributor will be solely responsible for, and agrees to accept exclusive liability for, complying with all applicable foreign, federal and state laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to Contributor or its agents under this Agreement. Contributor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest.  


**11\. GENERAL**  
**11.1 Governing Law**. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California as applied to transactions taking place wholly within California between California residents. In the event of a dispute, the parties agree to mediate in good faith before a neutral third party agreeable to both parties prior to instituting any legal action other than injunctive relief, such mediation to take place in the County of San Francisco, California. Contributor hereby expressly consents to the exclusive personal and subject-matter jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the County of San Francisco, California, for any dispute arising from or related to this Agreement.  

**11.2 Survival**. Any respective obligations of Contributor or GitLab hereunder which by their nature would continue beyond the termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement will survive such termination, cancellation or expiration.  

**11.3 Entire agreement; Amendment**. This Agreement together with any subsequent Statements of Work hereunder constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the services rendered by Contributor to GitLab, and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, commitments, representations, writings, and discussions between GitLab and Contributor, whether oral or written. This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by Contributor and an authorized officer of GitLab. Contributor expressly acknowledges that Contributor has read the terms of this Agreement, has had the opportunity to discuss those terms with her/his or her own legal counsel, and understands that this is a legally binding contract.  

**11.4 Notices**. Any notice, request, demand or other communication hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to be duly given (a) upon actual receipt when personally delivered to an officer of GitLab or to Contributor, as the case may be, (b) three days after deposit in the U.S. Mail by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested with postage prepaid, or (c) upon actual receipt or two days after being sent by reputable international overnight courier, delivery fees prepaid; in each case addressed to the addresses set forth on the signature page of this Agreement or to such other address as either party may specify by notice to the other as provided in this section.  

**11.5 Injunctive Relief**. Contributor acknowledges that, because Contributor’s services are personal and unique and because Contributor will have access to the Confidential Information of GitLab, any breach of this Agreement by Contributor would cause irreparable injury to GitLab for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle GitLab to injunctive relief (including specific performance). The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity.

This **Proprietary Information and Assignment Agreement** (“Agreement”) is made 
between {**GitLab Inc**., a Delaware corporation in the United States OR **GitLab BV**, 
a corporation in the Netherlands} (the “Company”) and **{Name of Contributor}** 
(“Contributor”), and is effective as of the last date under the signatures below (the “**Effective Date**”).

WHEREAS, the Company desires to employ or contract, or continue to employ or contract with Contributor to render services to the Company and Contributor desires to render such services;  
WHEREAS, as a material condition of and inducement for the Company sharing proprietary and confidential business relationships and information with Contributor, and providing training and other resources to Contributor, the Company requires Contributor to execute, deliver, and comply with this Agreement; and  
WHEREAS, for other good and valuable consideration provided at this time and during Contributor’s tenure, the adequacy and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by Contributor, Contributor and the Company agree:  

**1\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.**  
**A. Definition**. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any proprietary information including, without limitation, all information in whatever form provided which  
(i) in any way relates to the past, present or future business affairs of Company or its affiliates or their respective customers,  
(ii) is maintained in confidence by the Company or its affiliates,  
(iii) might permit the Company or its affiliates or their respective customers to obtain a competitive advantage over competitors who do not have access to such information which is disclosed by Company or its affiliates to Contributor,  
(iv) Contributor learns from inspection of drawings, products, systems, software, parts or equipment, or  
(v) the Company or its affiliates has a legal obligation to treat as confidential or which the Company or its affiliates treats as proprietary or designates as confidential for internal use only, whether or not owned or developed by the Company or its affiliates; including, without limitation, trade secrets, proprietary information, know-how, inventions, computer programs, computer code, technology, graphics, algorithms, engineering, formulas, processes, techniques, compositions of matter, sketches, drawings, models, diagrams, flow charts, apparatus, equipment, product specifications or designs, samples, product and service planning, client or customer lists, supplier lists, hardware configuration information, and information, research and development, business plans, business methods and processes, pricing and fee policies, information relating to operations, systems, security, merchandising, marketing, affiliate relations, products and product development, procurement requirements, business forecasts, financial and personnel data, and specialized knowledge, data or property concerning any idea, invention, discovery, process, program, services or products provided, used, developed, investigated, manufactured or considered by Company or its affiliates or any of their customers, whether commercial, experimental or patented, patentable, copyrightable or not.  

**B. Confidentiality Obligations**. During and after Contributor's tenure with the Company, Contributor will  
(i) keep secret and retain in the strictest confidence all Confidential Information, and will not directly or indirectly use, divulge, publish or otherwise or disclose or any such Confidential Information to be disclosed to, or used for the benefit of, anyone outside of Company without Company's prior written consent,  
(ii) not use Confidential Information except in the course of performing Contributor's duties for the Company or its affiliates and  
(iii) refrain from any action or conduct that might reasonably or foreseeably be expected to compromise the confidentiality or proprietary nature of the Confidential Information.  
Contributor may use the Confidential Information solely to perform services for the benefit of Company. Contributor will take all other reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of such Confidential Information and will treat all Confidential Information of Company with the same degree of care as Contributor accords to its own confidential information, but in no case less than reasonable care. Contributor will abide by all policies or practices established by the Company to protect Confidential Information. Contributor will immediately give notice to Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information and will assist Company in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure. Contributor shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software or other Confidential Information for any reason other than providing services to the Company.  

**C. Exceptions**. Contributor's obligations under Section 1(B) with respect to any portion of the Confidential Information will not apply to any such portion which Contributor can demonstrate:  
(i) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Contributor by Company through no fault of Contributor;  
(ii) was rightfully in Contributor's possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time such portion was communicated to Contributor by Company; or  
(iii) was developed by Contributor independently of and without reference to any information communicated to Contributor by Company.  
A disclosure of Confidential Information by Contributor after the termination of Contributor’s tenure in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body or otherwise required by law shall not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement or a waiver of confidentiality for other purposes; provided, however, that before such disclosure is made Contributor must provide prompt prior written notice thereof to Company to enable Company to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure.  

**D. No Breach of Confidentiality**. Contributor has not and will not  
(i) improperly use or disclose any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or other person or entity with which Contributor has an agreement or duty to keep in confidence information acquired by Contributor, if any, or  
(ii) bring on to the premises of Company any document or confidential or proprietary information belong to such employer, person or entity unless consented to in writing by such employer, person or entity.

**E. Third Party Information**. The Company may receive third party Confidential Information subject to disclosure or use restrictions. Contributor will comply with all such restrictions of which Contributor is notified. Contributor will use such third party Confidential Information only as necessary to carry out Contributor's duties for the Company, consistent with the Company's agreement with such third party.  

**F. Ownership and Return**. All Confidential Information, as well as all records, files and other memoranda made or kept by Contributor in connection with Contributor’s tenure, shall be the exclusive property of Company. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, for whatever reason, or upon Company's earlier request, Contributor will promptly deliver to Company all materials, notebooks, records, data, lists, information, memoranda, documents (including all copies) and all other property belonging to Company or containing Confidential Information, including, among other things, Confidential Information which relates to services provided or duties performed by Contributor.  


**2\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.**  
**A. Ownership; Assignment.** Contributor agrees to assign and hereby irrevocably assigns exclusively to Company or its designee, from the moment of inception or creation, without additional consideration of any kind other than the consideration recited herein and regardless of the termination of Contributor's relationship with the Company, all worldwide right, title and interest of Contributor and its personnel in and to all Inventions (defined below) that are conceived, discovered, developed, created or reduced to practice by Contributor, solely or in collaboration with others, that  
(i) relate to the services or the business or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company or any of its predecessors or affiliates,  
(ii) are developed using any of the equipment, supplies, facilities of the Company or any of its predecessors or affiliates or any Confidential Information or  
(iii) result from any work Contributor performs for the Company or any of its predecessors or affiliates, whether or not performed during business hours (individually and collectively, "Works").  
Contributor will make and maintain adequate and current records of all Works, which records will be and remain the property of Company. Contributor will promptly disclose to Company all Works. The Company and Contributor expressly agree that each copyrightable Work created in solely or jointly with others by Contributor pursuant to this Agreement at the direction of Company or relating to the business of the Company shall be considered a "work made for hire" to the maximum extent allowed by law, and that Company shall be considered the "author" of each such Work, as those terms are defined in the Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. §101, et seq; provided that if and to the extent that if any aspect of any Work is found as a matter of law not to be a “work made for hire” as contemplated above or any other Work is deemed for any reason to be owned by Contributor, then such Work shall not be a "work made for hire" and shall be subject to the assignment under this Section 2(A). Contributor's assignment of all right, title and interest in and to all Works is worldwide and perpetual and includes all intellectual property rights of any kind anywhere in the world. Contributor's assignment is valid and irrevocable and shall not lapse notwithstanding any delay or failure by the Company to exercise or exploit the rights so assigned for any period of time.  

**B. Definition of Inventions**. As used in this Agreement, "Inventions" means:  
(i) any new or useful invention, concept, art, discovery, machine, composition of matter, process, method, design, development, contribution, finding or improvement, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws in any jurisdiction,  
(ii) any and all copyrightable works, in any medium of expression,  
(iii) any and all trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names and trade dress, including all goodwill associated therewith,  
(iv) any and all patentable works, including any patents, divisions, continuations, continuations in part, applications, utility applications, provisional applications, substitute applications, reexaminations, reissues and extensions,  
(v) any and all software (including both object and source code), works of authorship, utility models, topography rights, database rights, formulas, methods, processes, manufacturing techniques, trade secrets, mask works and moral rights,  
(vi) any other intellectual property or proprietary rights anywhere in the world,  
(vii) any and all related know-how and rights to obtain, register, perfect and enforce any right or interest in any of (i) through (vi), and (viii) the right to sue for past infringement in connection with any of (i) through (vii).  

**C. No Designation as Inventor; Waiver of Moral Rights**. Contributor agrees that Company shall not be required to designate Contributor as the inventor or author of any Works. Contributor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all of Contributor's rights to such designation and any rights concerning future modifications to any Works. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Contributor hereby waives all claims to moral rights in and to any Works.  

**D. Further Assurances**. Contributor will assist Company, or its designee, at the Company’s expense, in every lawful way to secure, document and record the Company’s rights in Works and any copyrights, patents, trademarks, mask work rights, moral rights, or other intellectual property relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect to all Works, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments that the Company may deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns and nominees the sole and exclusive right, title and interest in and to all Works and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto. Contributor’s obligation to execute or cause to be executed any such instrument or papers shall continue after the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the termination of Contributor’s tenure with Company for any reason. Contributor will not assert or make a claim of ownership of any Works, and Contributor will not file any applications for patents or copyright or trademark registration relating to any Works.  

**E. Pre-Existing and Third Party Materials**. Contributor will not, in the course of tenure with the Company, incorporate into or in any way use in creating any Works any pre-existing invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery, works, or other proprietary right or information owned by Contributor or in which Contributor has an interest without Company's prior written permission. Contributor hereby grants the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use, sell, copy and distribute, and to use or exploit in any way and in any medium, whether or not now known or existing, such item as part of or in connection with such Works. Contributor will not incorporate any invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery, intellectual property or other proprietary information owned by any party other than Contributor into any Works without Company’s prior written permission.  

**F. Exceptions**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, Contributor understands that the provisions of this Section 2 shall not apply to any Invention that qualifies in all respects under Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides:  
“(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable. ”  
Contributor shall advise Company promptly and in writing of any of his or her previous or future works or inventions which he believes qualify under the California Labor Code Section 2870. Any such previous works are described in Exhibit A to this Agreement. The Company agrees to receive such information in confidence. If no such previous works are scheduled, then Contributor represents, acknowledges and agrees that there are no such prior inventions.  

**G. Attorney-in-Fact**. Contributor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Contributor’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on Contributor’s behalf to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyright, trademark and mask work registrations with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Contributor, if the Company is unable because of Contributor’s unavailability, dissolution, mental or physical incapacity, or for any other reason, to secure Contributor’s signature for the purpose of applying for or pursuing any application for any United States or foreign patents or mask work or copyright or trademark registrations covering the Works owned by the Company pursuant to this Section.  


**3\. CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS**.  
**A. Conflicts**. Contributor certifies that Contributor has no outstanding agreement or obligation that is in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement or that would preclude Contributor from complying with the provisions of this Agreement. Contributor will not enter into any such conflicting agreement during the term of this Agreement. Contributor’s violation of this Section will be considered a material breach of this Agreement.  

**B. Substantially Similar Designs**. Contributor will not, without Company’s prior written approval, design, disclose, create, or in any other way use or exploit any identical or substantially similar Works or intellectual property to that developed under this Agreement to or for any third party during the term of this Agreement and after the termination of this Agreement. Contributor acknowledges that the obligations in this Section are ancillary to Contributor’s nondisclosure obligations under Section 1.  


**4\. NON-SOLICITATION OF COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS**.  
In order to protect Company's confidential and proprietary information and to prevent undesired and unnecessary business interruption, Contributor shall not, directly or indirectly, during tenure with the Company, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, solicit, interfere with, or induce any person, who is or was a Contributor of Company, to  
(A) discontinue his, her or its relationship with Company, or  
(B) accept employment by, or enter into a business relationship with Contributor, or any other entity or person unless Company has approved of such business or employment relationship beforehand in writing.
Contributor acknowledges that this Section is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the business of Company and its affiliates, and that part of the compensation paid under this Agreement is in consideration for the provisions contained in this Section.  


**5\. NOTICES**.  
Any notice to be given or required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed sufficiently given if personally delivered or mailed, with postage prepaid, by registered mail, addressed to the Company c/o its Chief Executive Officer at his or her principal business address or Contributor at Contributor’s residence address on file with the Company.  


**6\. ASSIGNMENT**.  
This Agreement, including all rights and assignments granted by Contributor under this Agreement, is assignable by the Company including, without limitation, to any affiliate of the Company or any entity with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by such successors or assigns without the necessity that this Agreement be re-signed at the time of such assignment. Contributor shall not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under this Agreement to any other person or entity, including without limitation by operation of law, merger, sale of all or substantially all of Contributor's assets or otherwise.  


**7\. GENERAL**.  
**A. Injunctive Relief**. Contributor's obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; Contributor's breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Company for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and, in the event of such breach, Company will be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other and further relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if appropriate).  

**B. Compliance**. Contributor will comply and do all things necessary for the Company to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and with the provisions of all Contributors entered into by the Company that relate to Works or to the safeguarding of Confidential Information.  

**C. Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be found by the applicable judicial authority of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time, or over too great a range of activities, or over too broad a geographic area, or for any other reason, then such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law and to extend over a maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable, and the entire Agreement shall not fail on account thereof, but otherwise shall remain in full force and effect.  

**D. Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement will be binding upon Contributor's heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors, and its assigns.  

**E. Term of Agreement; Effect of Termination**. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for the duration of Contributor's tenure with Company and thereafter until terminated in a written agreement signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is terminated by operation of law for any reason, all other parties shall survive.  

**F. Attorneys’ Fees**. In any legal action or other proceeding brought to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.  

**G. Entire Agreement**. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties relating to the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussions between the Parties. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by the party to be charged. Any subsequent change or changes in Contributor's services or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement. If, in one or more instances, either party fails to insist upon performance of any of the terms of this Agreement, and the obligations of both parties shall continue in full force and effect.
