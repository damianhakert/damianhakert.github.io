## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>

These agreements are examples of the agreements that we currently use at GitLab. However, the terms and conditions of an employee or
contractor’s agreement will vary based on each employee or contractor’s specific circumstances. GitLab reserves the right to amend or
change the sample agreements, as well as each employee or contractor’s actual agreement. The samples below are samples only — they are not
valid as such and do not replace personalized signed agreements.

## How to use this page to prepare a contract <a name="how-to-use"></a>

Assuming that the [hiring process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/) went smoothly, now it is time to prepare the applicable contracts.
The following set of steps should suffice:

1. The currency should normally be the local currency of the new team member unless they explicitly request USD/EUR because their local currency has a lot of inflation.
1. Employee entity: employ though the GitLab entity where they are located (US => Inc., NL => B.V.)
1. Contractor entity: if the team member is in the US, or if the person is part of the Sales organization, GitLab Inc. is the contracting entity. In all other regions and functional groups, GitLab BV is the contracting entity.
1. Make a copy of the relevant Template Contract (linked below) in Drive, and include the name of the new hire in the title of the copy.
1. Find all fields with curly brackets (` { } `), and edit as appropriate. It is often efficient to do a find + replace on fields that appear multiple times such as names, email
addresses, etc. (fields are named the same in the contracts / PIAA to make this easier).
1. When removing optional clauses, take care that the paragraph / section numbering still makes sense (especially for the GitLab Inc offer letter).
1. Have the contract reviewed, per the guideline on the [Hiring page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).
1. [Process new contract(s) via HelloSign](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#hellosign) (also see [how to get legal documents signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) ).
1. If you are processing a GitLab Inc. contractor agreement, also send a W9. The template can be found in HelloSign. 
1. Once the contract is signed, place the signed pdf in the team member's folder in BambooHR.
1. Delete the google doc that was used for the preparation of the contract; it is superseded by the signed version in BambooHR.
