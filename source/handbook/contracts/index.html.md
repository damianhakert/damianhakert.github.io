These agreements are examples of the agreements that we currently use at GitLab. However, the terms and conditions of an employee or
contractor’s agreement will vary based on each employee or contractor’s specific circumstances. GitLab reserves the right to amend or
change the sample agreements, as well as each employee or contractor’s actual agreement. The samples below are samples only — they are not
valid as such and do not replace personalized signed agreements.

## How to use this page to prepare a contract <a name="how-to-use"></a>

Assuming that the [hiring process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/) went smoothly, now it is time to prepare the applicable contracts.
The following set of steps should suffice:

1. The currency should normally be the local currency of the new team member unless they explicitly request USD/EUR because their local currency has a lot of inflation.
1. Employee entity: employ though the GitLab entity where they are located (US => Inc., NL => B.V.)
1. Contractor entity: if the employee is in the US, GitLab Inc. is the contracting entity, in all other regions GitLab BV is the contracting entity.
1. Download the right contract or offer letter template from the "In Process of Hiring" file on the Documents page of [BambooHR](https://gitlab.bamboohr.com)
1. Remember that regardless of the status of the new team member, i.e. contractor or employee for either GitLab Inc., or GitLab BV,
 an NDA and IP Agreement (called a PIAA for the Inc. entity) must be included with the contract.
1. Find all fields with curly brackets (` { } `), and edit as appropriate. It is often efficient
to do a find + replace on fields that appear multiple times such as names, email
addresses, etc. (fields are named the same in the contracts / PIAA to make this easier).
1. When removing optional clauses, take care that the paragraph / section numbering still makes sense (especially for the GitLab Inc offer letter).
1. Have the contract reviewed, per the guideline on the [Hiring page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).
1. [Process new contract(s) via HelloSign](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#hellosign) (also see [how to get legal documents signed](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#signing-legal-documents) ).

## INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SERVICES AGREEMENT

This **Independent Contractor Services Agreement** (“**Agreement**”) is between
**GitLab Inc.** (“**GitLab**”), and **{Name of Contributor}**
having a place of business or residence as set forth below (“**Contributor**”).
This Agreement is effective as of the last date under the signatures below (the “**Effective Date**”).

WHEREAS GitLab and Contributor desire to create an independent contractor relationship
in connection with certain services to be provided by Contributor to GitLab, as described
below, the parties agree as follows:

**1\. WORK AND COMPENSATION**.

Contributor agrees to perform the work set forth in **Exhibit A** (“**Statement of
Work**”) and to provide any work product resulting therefrom to GitLab. Contributor
will be paid compensation in the amount and at the times set forth in **Exhibit B**,
subject to timely submission of any deliverables in accordance with the schedule in
the applicable Statement of Work. Unless other terms are set forth in **Exhibit B**,
GitLab will pay Contributor for services within fifteen (15) days of the date of receipt
of Contributor’s summary invoice. Contributor will provide GitLab with reasonable
documentation and work description in connection with Contributor’s invoices, as
requested by GitLab.


**2\. TERM**.

**2.1 Completion of Services**. This Agreement will become effective on the Effective
Date and will continue in effect until completion of the Statement of Work as set
forth in **Exhibit A** or any subsequent Statements of Work as set forth in Section
2.2, unless terminated earlier as set forth in Section 8.

**2.2 Subsequent Statements of Work**. Contributor and GitLab may from time to time
execute subsequent Statements of Work in the form of **Exhibit D**, each of which
will be deemed to be part of this Agreement upon the earlier of (a) the date of mutual
execution of the subsequent Statement of Work or (b) the date when Contributor commences
any work described on a subsequent Statement of Work that has been duly executed by GitLab.
To the extent any terms set forth on any subsequent Statement of Work conflict with
the terms of this Agreement, the terms on the Statement of Work will prevail, but
only with respect to the subject work described therein.


**3\. RESPONSIBILITIES**

Contributor will perform and promptly complete the Statement of Work set forth in
**Exhibit A** in a professional and timely manner consistent with industry standards
at a location, place and time that Contributor deems appropriate. Contributor, in
its sole discretion, will determine the manner, method, details and means of performing
work under a Statement of Work, but may not subcontract or otherwise delegate its
obligations under this Agreement, nor employ any agents or employees to perform such
obligations without the prior written consent of GitLab. Contributor is expected to
provide its own equipment, tools, and other materials at its own expense in performing
work under the Statement of Work.

**3.1 Acceptance or Rejection of Work**. Upon Contributor’s submission of the work
product, GitLab will, in its sole discretion, accept or reject all or part of the work
product or return it to Contributor with suggested changes. Contributor acknowledges
that if the unaccepted portion of the work product contains any Confidential Information
or GitLab Materials, then GitLab will retain sole and exclusive ownership of such
property, and Contributor will either return the unaccepted work product to GitLab
or provide GitLab with satisfactory evidence that the unaccepted work product has been destroyed.

**3.2 Modification of Work Product**. If GitLab requires a change to the work product,
it will notify Contributor of the requested change and the due date for resubmitting
the revised work product. GitLab may accept or reject all or part of the corrected
work product at its sole discretion. GitLab will have no obligation to return any
accepted work product to Contributor. GitLab has the right to edit or adapt any work
product in any manner, including, without limitation, with respect to its form, medium,
format, delivery mechanism or content as GitLab deems appropriate. Contributor agrees
to provide GitLab with the information and know-how necessary for GitLab to edit or
adapt the work product, at no additional cost to GitLab, and will cooperate with GitLab
in any such editing or adaptation. If the work product is an article or other written
piece, Contributor agrees to provide to GitLab with the work product, a written bibliography
and list of sources contacted in the process of researching and preparing such work product
and include captions and pull quotes where appropriate.


**4\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY, NON-SOLICITATION**

Contributor and GitLab agree to bound by the separate **Proprietary Information and
Assignment Agreement** entered into by Contributor and GitLab, describing the agreements
between Contributor and GitLab with respect to Confidential Information, Ownership of
Property, and Non-Solicitation.


**5\. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**

Contributor agrees that during the term of this Agreement, Contributor will not,
without GitLab’s express written consent, engage in any employment or business activity
that is competitive with, or would otherwise create a conflict of interest with Contributor’s obligations to GitLab.


**6\. INDEMNIFICATION**

Contributor will indemnify and hold harmless GitLab, its parents, stockholders,
officers, directors, employees, sub-licensees, customers and agents (collectively the
“**Indemnified Parties**”) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
expenses and costs (including attorneys’ fees and court costs) that result from a
breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty of Contributor (a “**Claim**”),
except to the extent that such Claim is directly and entirely attributable to material
that GitLab provided to the Contributor for performance of a Statement of Work.


**7\. NONDISPARAGEMENT**.

Contributor will not, during and after the term of this Agreement, disparage or defame
GitLab to anyone, including, without limitation, its other Contributors, GitLab employees,
officers, directors, services, business, or manner of doing business.


**8\. TERMINATION**.

**8.1 Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated by either GitLab or Contributor
for any reason on fifteen (15) days’ written notice to the other Party or such longer
period as may be specified in the attached exhibits. In the event that Contributor gives
notice of termination during the performance of the Statement of Work, the terms of the
Agreement will govern completion, acceptance and payment by GitLab for any work product.

**8.2 Return of Materials**. Following any notice of termination of this Agreement given
pursuant to Section 8.1 or upon expiration of the term of this Agreement, Contributor will
fully cooperate with GitLab in all matters relating to the winding up of Contributor’s
pending work on behalf of GitLab and the orderly transfer of any work or documents to GitLab.
Contributor agrees that, at the time of terminating Contributor’s engagement with GitLab
and at any other time GitLab requests, Contributor will deliver to GitLab any and all devices,
materials, software, records, data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence,
specifications, drawings, blueprints, sketches, equipment, other documents or property,
or reproductions of any aforementioned items (in whole or in part) belonging to GitLab,
its successors, or assigns, or embodying GitLab’s Confidential Information or work product
developed under this Agreement (collectively “**GitLab Materials**”). Contributor may not
retain any GitLab Materials without the written authorization of an authorized GitLab officer.

**8.3 GitLab Materials**. Contributor agrees it will not use GitLab Materials for any purpose
other than in performance of the Statement of Work. Upon termination, Contributor agrees to
sign and deliver the “Termination Certification” attached hereto as **Exhibit C**. Contributor
will not, during or after Contributor’s engagement with GitLab, deliver or transfer to any
person, or use, without written authorization by an authorized GitLab officer any GitLab Materials or other property owned by GitLab.


**9\. ASSIGNMENT**.

The rights and obligations of Contributor are personal in nature and
may not be assigned without GitLab’s prior written consent. The rights and obligations of
GitLab under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon the successors and assignees of GitLab.


**10\. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP**.

Contributor’s relationship with GitLab will be that of an independent contractor and
nothing in this Agreement should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture,
or employer-employee relationship. Contributor is not the agent of GitLab and is not
authorized to make any representation, contract, or commitment on behalf of GitLab.
Contributor will not be entitled to any of the benefits which GitLab may make available
to its employees, including, but not limited to, group insurance, stock option plans,
profit-sharing or retirement benefits. For US-based contractors, GitLab will regularly
report amounts paid to Contributor by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue
Service, as required by law. Because Contributor is an independent contractor, GitLab
will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or
disability insurance contributions, or obtain worker’s compensation insurance on Contributor’s
behalf. Contributor will be solely responsible for, and agrees to accept exclusive liability
for, complying with all applicable foreign, federal and state laws governing self-employed
individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability
and other contributions based on fees paid to Contributor or its agents under this Agreement.
Contributor hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties against
any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest.


**11\. GENERAL**

**11.1 Governing Law**. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California as applied to transactions taking place wholly
within California between California residents. In the event of a dispute, the parties
agree to mediate in good faith before a neutral third party agreeable to both parties
prior to instituting any legal action other than injunctive relief, such mediation to
take place in the County of San Francisco, California. Contributor hereby expressly
consents to the exclusive personal and subject-matter jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located in the County of San Francisco, California, for any dispute
arising from or related to this Agreement.

**11.2 Survival**. Any respective obligations of Contributor or GitLab hereunder which
by their nature would continue beyond the termination, cancellation or expiration of this
Agreement will survive such termination, cancellation or expiration.

**11.3 Entire agreement; Amendment**. This Agreement together with any subsequent
Statements of Work hereunder constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
regarding the services rendered by Contributor to GitLab, and this Agreement supersedes
all prior or contemporaneous agreements, commitments, representations, writings, and
discussions between GitLab and Contributor, whether oral or written. This Agreement may
be amended only by a writing executed by Contributor and an authorized officer of GitLab.
Contributor expressly acknowledges that Contributor has read the terms of this Agreement,
has had the opportunity to discuss those terms with her/his or her own legal counsel, and
understands that this is a legally binding contract.

**11.4 Notices**. Any notice, request, demand or other communication hereunder will be
in writing and will be deemed to be duly given (a) upon actual receipt when personally
delivered to an officer of GitLab or to Contributor, as the case may be, (b) three days
after deposit in the U.S. Mail by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested
with postage prepaid, or (c) upon actual receipt or two days after being sent by reputable
international overnight courier, delivery fees prepaid; in each case addressed to the addresses
set forth on the signature page of this Agreement or to such other address as either party
may specify by notice to the other as provided in this section.

**11.5 Injunctive Relief**. Contributor acknowledges that, because Contributor’s
services are personal and unique and because Contributor will have access to the
Confidential Information of GitLab, any breach of this Agreement by Contributor would
cause irreparable injury to GitLab for which monetary damages would not be an adequate
remedy and, therefore, will entitle GitLab to injunctive relief (including specific performance).
The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and
in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity.

**11.6 Interpretation; Severability**. Section and other headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is considered unclear or ambiguous,
it will not be construed against the party that drafted the provision, but instead will
be construed to effectuate the intent of both parties as expressed in this Agreement.
Should any valid federal or state law or final determination of any administrative
agency or court of competent jurisdiction invalidate or otherwise affect any provision
of this Agreement, any provision so affected will be conformed automatically and to
the extent possible to the law or determination in question and enforced insofar as
possible consistent with the intent of the parties, and in all events the remaining
provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

**11.7 Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original.

**11.8 Attorney's Fees**. If an action is brought to interpret or enforce the terms
of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing
party, in addition to all other remedies at law and equity, all costs and expenses
incurred by the prevailing party with respect to such action, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements.

Contributor's assignment of all right, title and interest in and to all Works is worldwide and perpetual and includes all intellectual property rights of any kind anywhere in the world. Contributor's assignment is valid and irrevocable and shall not lapse notwithstanding any delay or failure by the Company to exercise or exploit the rights so assigned for any period of time.

Contributor will not, in the course of tenure with the Company, incorporate into or in any way use in creating any Works any pre-existing invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery, works, or other proprietary right or information owned by Contributor or in which Contributor has an interest without Company's prior written permission. Contributor hereby grants the Company a nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use, sell, copy and distribute, and to use or exploit in any way and in any medium, whether or not now known or existing, such item as part of or in connection with such Works. Contributor will not incorporate any invention, improvement, development, concept, discovery, intellectual property or other proprietary information owned by any party other than Contributor into any Works without Company’s prior written permission.

**F. Exceptions**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2, Contributor understands that the provisions of this Section 2 shall not apply to any Invention that qualifies in all respects under Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which provides:<br>
“(a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time without using the employer's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information except for those inventions that either: (1) Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer's business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or (2) Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer. (b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable. ”<br>
Contributor shall advise Company promptly and in writing of any of his or her previous or future works or inventions which he believes qualify under the California Labor Code Section 2870. Any such previous works are described in Exhibit A to this Agreement. The Company agrees to receive such information in confidence. If no such previous works are scheduled, then Contributor represents, acknowledges and agrees that there are no such prior inventions.

**G. Attorney-in-Fact**. Contributor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as Contributor’s agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on Contributor’s behalf to execute and file any such applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patents, copyright, trademark and mask work registrations with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Contributor, if the Company is unable because of Contributor’s unavailability, dissolution, mental or physical incapacity, or for any other reason, to secure Contributor’s signature for the purpose of applying for or pursuing any application for any United States or foreign patents or mask work or copyright or trademark registrations covering the Works owned by the Company pursuant to this Section.


**3\. CONFLICTING OBLIGATIONS**.

**A. Conflicts**. Contributor certifies that Contributor has no outstanding agreement or obligation that is in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement or that would preclude Contributor from complying with the provisions of this Agreement. Contributor will not enter into any such conflicting agreement during the term of this Agreement. Contributor’s violation of this Section will be considered a material breach of this Agreement.

**B. Substantially Similar Designs**. Contributor will not, without Company’s prior written approval, design, disclose, create, or in any other way use or exploit any identical or substantially similar Works or intellectual property to that developed under this Agreement to or for any third party during the term of this Agreement and after the termination of this Agreement. Contributor acknowledges that the obligations in this Section are ancillary to Contributor’s nondisclosure obligations under Section 1.


**4\. NON-SOLICITATION OF COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS**.

In order to protect Company's confidential and proprietary information and to prevent undesired and unnecessary business interruption, Contributor shall not, directly or indirectly, during tenure with the Company, and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, solicit, interfere with, or induce any person, who is or was a Contributor of Company, to<br>
(A) discontinue his, her or its relationship with Company, or<br>
(B) accept employment by, or enter into a business relationship with Contributor, or any other entity or person unless Company has approved of such business or employment relationship beforehand in writing.<br>
Contributor acknowledges that this Section is reasonable and necessary for the protection of the business of Company and its affiliates, and that part of the compensation paid under this Agreement is in consideration for the provisions contained in this Section.


**5\. NOTICES**.

Any notice to be given or required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed sufficiently given if personally delivered or mailed, with postage prepaid, by registered mail, addressed to the Company c/o its Chief Executive Officer at his or her principal business address or Contributor at Contributor’s residence address on file with the Company.


**6\. ASSIGNMENT**.

This Agreement, including all rights and assignments granted by Contributor under this Agreement, is assignable by the Company including, without limitation, to any affiliate of the Company or any entity with which, or into which, the Company may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by such successors or assigns without the necessity that this Agreement be re-signed at the time of such assignment. Contributor shall not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under this Agreement to any other person or entity, including without limitation by operation of law, merger, sale of all or substantially all of Contributor's assets or otherwise.


**7\. GENERAL**.

**A. Injunctive Relief**. Contributor's obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; Contributor's breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Company for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and, in the event of such breach, Company will be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other and further relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if appropriate).

**B. Compliance**. Contributor will comply and do all things necessary for the Company to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and with the provisions of all Contributors entered into by the Company that relate to Works or to the safeguarding of Confidential Information.

**C. Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
shall for any reason and to any extent be found by the applicable judicial authority of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable because it extends for too
long a period of time, or over too great a range of activities, or over too broad a
geographic area, or for any other reason, then such provision shall be modified to
the extent necessary to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law and to
extend over a maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which
it may be enforceable, and the entire Agreement shall not fail on account thereof,
but otherwise shall remain in full force and effect.

Agreement is terminated by operation of law for any reason, all other provisions shall survive.

**F. Attorneys’ Fees**. In any legal action or other proceeding brought to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

**G. Entire Agreement**. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties relating to the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussions between the Parties. No modification of or amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by the party to be charged. Any subsequent change or changes in Contributor's services or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this Agreement. If, in one or more instances, either party fails to insist upon performance of any of the terms of this Agreement, and the obligations of both parties shall continue in full force and effect.
