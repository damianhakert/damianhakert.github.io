## Common Links

- Security crosses many teams in the company, but most often security related issues are posted in the [public Infrastructure issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/infrastructure/issues/), or [gitlab-ce], or even [organization] trackers with the `~security` label. Please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at GitLab.
- [Chat channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/security); please use the `#securit` chat channel for questions that don't seem appropriate to use the issue tracker or the internal email address for.
- [Frequently asked questions about Security of GitLab](/security) _the application_  as well as GitLab _the organization_  are documented on the top-level [security page](/security).
- [Security Best Practices](/handbook/security), using 1Password and similar tools, are documented on their own [security best practices page](/handbook/security).
