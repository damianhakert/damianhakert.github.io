## Requesting design help

1. Create an issue in the corresponding project repository
    1. For tasks pertaining to [about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/) create an issue in the [www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues).
    1. For all other marketing related tasks create an issue in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues).
1. Add all relevant details, goal(s), purpose, resources, and links in the issue description. Also `@` mention team members who will be involved.
1. Set due date (if possible) — small last-minute requests are OK, we understand, but in order to do our best work let's not make a habit of it.
1. Add the `Design` and `Website Redesign` (if applicable) label(s) to your issue.

## The `Design` label in issue tracker

The `Design` label helps us find and track issues relevant to the Design team. If you create an issue where Design is the primary focus, please use this label.

## Project prioritization

The prioritization of design projects is based on the [company goals](/handbook/marketing/#focus-for-q3-and-q4) as defined in the marketing handbook. If a proposed project directly effects one or several of these goals it is deemed a high priority. In addition to our company goals, priority is also based on Design's quarterly [OKRs](/handbook/marketing/#okrs).

Any design requests that do not fall in line with the company goals or Design OKRs will be given a lower priority and factored in as time allows.
