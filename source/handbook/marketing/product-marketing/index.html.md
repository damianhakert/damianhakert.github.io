## Key Responsibilities<a name="responsibilities"></a>

At the highest level, the goal of product marketing is to communicate the value of our product
or services to our target audience.

Product marketing has three primary responsibilities.

1. **Analysis**: Product marketing is responsible for researching and analyzing the market, competition, product, and customer to find unique insights that aid the sales process.
2. **Messaging**: Product marketing is responsible for defining and managing the value proposition, messaging, and positioning of new and existing products and features.
3. **Enablement**: Product marketing is responsible for listening to the sales teams to understand the challenges and opportunities they face in the sales process. Additionally, product marketing supports the sales team with collateral, training, and go-to-market strategy.

## Release Management<a name="release-management"></a>

### Release Kickoff

The goal is to enable sales and marketing/PR to work one release ahead of the product release cycle. The proposed process to get us there is below.   

- After the kickoff meeting Job and Amara will agree on priority features
- A sister marketing issue will be created in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing) for each priority feature
- In the sister issue, the developer working on the feature will work to answer the following:
    - Who are we building the feature for
    - What pain will the feature solve
    - How will the user/team/admin benefit from having the feature (focus on measurable benefits)
    - How will this feature change a user/team/admins workflow (e.g. this used to be a 10-step process now it is 1-click)
    - What are the current limitations
- Prod. Marketing will answer the following
    - What is the competitive landscape
    - What are the key selling points
    - How will we message it

### Release Checklist 

The goal of our release checklist is to highlight what should be completed with each release.  

- Verify that the work for the last release was documented and issue was closed 
- Release issue using the `release` label was created in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing) 
- Priority features that were agreed upon in the release kickoff were mentioned in this release issue
- Priority features have been scheduled or demoed in GitLab University
- Marketing plan for priority features has been documented
- Priority features are fully documented with screenshots (align with technical writers)
- Priority features are shown on /features or updated in other website pages
- Priority features appear in the compare view on /features
- /direction is updated 
- Evaluate the opportunity to update existing screens or copy on pages that will be updated for the release
- Document changes made to the site in the release issue

## Sales Enablement<a name="sales-enablement"></a>

The goal of sales enablement is to empower the sales team with training, collateral, and go-to-market. 

### Sales Playbook

* Gitlab 25, 50, 100 word description
* GitLab pitch deck
* GitLab product breakdown sheet
* Buyer persona
* Customer stories, testimonials, and eventual case studies

    * CE to EE sales tear sheet (Key selling points, messaging for features, trap-setting questions, proof points)
