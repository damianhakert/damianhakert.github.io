# GitLab Marketing Mission: GitLab for All!<a name="mission"></a>

We think GitLab (.com, CE, and EE) can help developers, designers, IT workers, marketers, and everyone in between improve collaboration.  

The GitLab marketing team is composed of a unique set of individuals from interesting backgrounds all over the world. Because of our unique skill sets, we're able to accomplish a lot of high impact campaigns through collaboration and open feedback from our team and the community.  

Here are some marketing resources we think help to describe how we work:

# Marketing OKRs<a name="okrs"></a>

Our team and the demands on marketing are growing quickly. In order to align our goals with company goals as well as prioritize what we are working on, OKRs help us to maintain structure. Of course, not everything can be captured in one Google Sheet but this helps us all to know what we consider our goals as a team to be.  

Each member of the marketing team is responsible for 3 Objectives and 3 Key Results for each objective.  

To find the GitLab Marketing Team's OKRs, search the company Google Drive for "Marketing OKRs - Quarterly".

- What is an OKR? Objectives and Key Results
- Objectives are goals
- Key Results are measurement
- OKRS help to prioritize and align
- OKRs are set quarterly
- OKRs are NOT a measurement of performance.
- Set goals that arenâ€™t easy to hit.
- Graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Normal is around .8
