<div class="alert alert-purple center"><h3 class="purple"><strong>GITLAB FOR ALL</strong></h3></div>

We think GitLab (.com, CE, and EE) can help developers, designers, IT workers, marketers, and everyone in between improve collaboration.

The GitLab marketing team is composed of a unique set of individuals from interesting backgrounds all over the world. Because of our unique skill sets, we're able to accomplish a lot of high impact campaigns through collaboration and open feedback from our team and the community.

Our Marketing team is split into four key functional groups. All four groups are important for the success of GitLab.

## <i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw purple font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i> Marketing OKRs
{: #okrs}

Our team and the demands on marketing are growing quickly. In order to align our goals with company goals as well as prioritize what we are working on, OKRs help us to maintain structure. Of course, not everything can be captured in one Google Sheet but this helps us all to know what we consider our goals as a team to be.  

Each member of the marketing team is responsible for 3 Objectives and 3 Key Results for each objective.  

To find the GitLab Marketing Team's OKRs, search the company Google Drive for "Marketing OKRs - Quarterly".

- What is an OKR? **Objectives and Key Results**
- Objectives are goals
- Key Results are measurement
- OKRs help to prioritize and align
- OKRs are set quarterly
- OKRs are NOT a measurement of performance.
- Set goals that aren’t easy to hit.
- Graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Normal is around .8
- [Quick overview of OKRs](http://www.slideshare.net/HenrikJanVanderPol/how-to-outperform-anyone-else-introduction-to-okr)

## <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up fa-fw purple font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i> Marketing team SLAs (Service Level Agreements)
{: #sla}

When working remotely in such a quick moving organization, it is important for a team to agree on a few basic service level agreements on how we would like to work together. With anything, things can come up that make it not possible to meet these SLAs but we all agree to use best effort when possible.    

- Respond to your emails by end of next business day.
- Respond when you are cc'd with an action item on issues by end of next business day.  
- Be on time to meetings. We start at on time.  
- Acknowledge receipt of emails (community@, FYIs) by BCC'ing the list.
- Try not to email co-workers on weekends. Try out [Boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/) and set all your emails to send Monday morning at 6 AM. People will think you're up and working early! Time off is important. We all have stressful weeks so please unplug on the weekends where possible.
- Do not ping someone in a public channel on Slack on the weekends. This is rude.

## <i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-fw orange font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i> Marketing Handbook Updates

Anything that is a process in marketing should be documented in the Marketing Handbook.

    - Welcome to the Handbook.
    - Functional group overview if handbook for entire functional group or organization.
    - "On this page" index of all top level headers on the current page ([create a ToC]).
    - Links to other handbooks included on this page.
- Rather than create many nested pages, include everything on one page of your role's handbook with an index at the top.
- Each role should have a handbook page.
- If more than one person are performing a role, the task should be shared to update the handbook with all process or guidelines.
- Follow the [Markdown Style Guide] for about.GitLab.com.
