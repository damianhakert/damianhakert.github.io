## Write for GitLab

We’ve opened [our blog] up to contributions from the community.

When you get published on our blog **you can earn up to $200** for technical articles. If you’re accepted, you’ll get feedback on your writing, and be guided through making the best resources. Find out how to get started!

All great contributions come from developers “scratching their own itch.” It’s likely you can share some advice to help someone along the way. You can contribute the technical content you wish was available.

## How it works

1.  [Choose a topic](#topics) and submit a writing sample to us
2.  Get approved
3.  Start writing, get feedback and revise
4.  Publish
5.  Get paid

First you’ll submit a writing sample and tell us about your areas of expertise. After you get approved, we’ll contact you to initiate the writing process. We will review in-depth your post, and you’ll get detailed feedback on your writing before we push the article to publication. Once it’s published you’ll get paid.

## Compensation

In terms of pricing, we looked to the industry to see what were the going rates. Your feedback is welcome. Here are our rough guidelines for rates:

- Short tutorials of 800-1500 words: **earn USD 100.00**
- In-depth tutorials or opinion pieces of 1,500+ words: **earn USD 150.00**
- Top-priority: **earn PLUS USD 50.00**

Post with less than 800 words, as articles on quick tips and feature highlights, are also very welcome, but will not be compensated for.

## What we're looking for

We’re inviting community contribution so we can expand the range of tutorials and advice about creating, collaborating and deploying with GitLab.

It's important that the content is:

- Accurate
- Complete
- Original

## Topics

To find out what topics we're looking for, review the blog post backlog and see if there are any existing requests for topics that inspire you. You can either [look for labeled issues](#look-for-labeled-posts) or [file a new one](example-topic-areas).

### Look for Labeled Posts

Navigate to the [Blog Posts issue tracker][topics-issues] and look for issues [labeled](../#labels) with:

- [Community Posts]
- [Up-for-grabs]
- [$100]
- [$150]
- [TOP PRIORITY +$50]

For issues labeled with `TOP PRIORITY +$50`, the post will be worth the regular USD 100.00 or USD 150.00 according to its length and criteria, and you will earn plus USD 50.00 for high-priority subjects. Yay!

### Example topic areas

If the subject you want to write about is not there, feel free to add a new issue with it, explaining why do you think that is important for the GitLab Community.
In this case, there are a some topics we're opened to consider, such as:

- Migrating to GitLab (from GitHub, BitBucket, etc)
- Using GitLab to build, test, and/or deploy your app
- Build and Deploy Android apps with GitLab CI
- Build and Deploy iOS apps with GitLab CI
- Windows / Windows Phone + GitLab
- Build/deploy PHP applications with GitLab
- Build/deploy C++ applications with GitLab
- Deploying your app from GitLab to a server with GitLab CI
- Using GitLab environments to preview your app in staging before deploying to production
- Feature highlight: how did you use GitLab features to help you
- Concepts: Open Source, [CI/CD/CD], [ConvDev], Microservices, SaaS, etc
- Workflow: how GitLab facilitated your workflow
- GitLab Pages: setup with GitLab EE
- GitLab Pages: your new SSG (how to setup GitLab CI for your SSG) - not the ones included in the [Pages group]
- Integrations: GitLab + something (except from the ones written by companies' employees, CEOs, etc: those are [Guest Posts](../#guest-posts) and will not be be part of the Community Writers Program)
- GitLab CI for \<your proposal>
- Comparison posts, e.g., Git v W; GitLab v X; GitLab CI v Y; GitLab EE v Z
- Migrating from X to Git and/or GitLab
- Working with GitLab, feature highlights and tutorials
- Ways of boosting efficiency
- Extending capability with integrations
- Improving communication in code-collaboration
- Managing open source projects
- Testing X with GitLab CI
- Case studies

## Writing Process

We have some stantards, so please, make sure you've **read them before submitting your proposal**. The technical process of writing and reviewing can be found in our Handbooks: [GitLab Blog] and [Technical Writing].

## Publishing Process

Read through the [Publishing Process for Community Writers](#publishing-process-for-community-writers).

## Get Paid

When your post gets published, it's time to claim for your compensation. You will send us an invoice, GitLab will pay you in American Dollars (USD) from a bank account in the USA, via wired transfer to your bank account. We can deal with other possible payment methods via credit card, but please discuss it with us before start writing.

_**Note:** When you start writing for GitLab, we assume you have accepted the terms described along this page._

## Important Notes and Exceptions

- If you want to write about your own product (or the product you represent), and how it integrates with GitLab, we'll be happy to have you as a [Guest Writer](../#guest-posts). The Community Writers Program won't apply for these cases.
- Once your community post gets published, we'll count on you for providing updates for the process you wrote about, for one year from the publishing date. We won't compensate you for updates.
- You are free to offer yourself to write more than one post. If you succeed on the first process, we'll be glad to have you writing for us regularly. The process for writing more than one post is exactly the same for writing the first one.
- The review we provide is necessary. You're free to discuss and make your point, but you need to take into account the experience of our reviewers and the QA standards they will require from you.
- Your post needs to be approved by the Blog Editorial Team to get published.
- Your post must be original, comprehensible, technical, and unprecedented. We won't accept non-original content, unless you want to publish your post as a [Crosspost](../#crossposts), which we don't compensate for.
