### Ownership &amp; responsibilities

The [Website](https://about.gitlab.com) is product owned by [RÃ©gis Freyd](https://about.gitlab.com/team/#djaiss) and worked on by the [Product Marketing](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/) team who are responsible for updating the design and content.

When techninical product content is needed (e.g. technical capabilities of the API), the Product Marketing team may seek assistance from the Technical Writing team by creating and assigning sub-issues to [Sean Packham](https://about.gitlab.com/team/#SeanPackham), the Technical Writing Lead.

### Objectives

Generate MQLs by:

1. Showcasing the benefits of the most important GitLab features and how they can save time and money.
2. Compare GitLab vs competing products.
3. Provide customer case studies which illustrate 1 and 2.
