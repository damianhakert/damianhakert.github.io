title: "Developer Marketing"
---

Some of this was based on a conversation with Tim Anglade of Realm.io, great insights are his, mistakes are ours. Thanks to Tim for helping us!

Some content from Heather McNamee her presentation [Developer Marketing Brainstorm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCOSWFysoEfYbnAQcqteWjQYQzzphW0Gd0XRcTXYHVw/edit#) (invite only).

## Content

* The content doesn't have to be about GitLab, it can also be other content aimed at developers, Hacker News or team leads.
* You need to have high quality and high volume
* What worked for Apigee was the 'collaboration in the 21st century' theme
* Video's with good screencasts, great subtitles, and narratives are expensive but popular, and hard to copy (what does happens to written content), Realm.io does a lot of good video's, for example [about Swift](https://realm.io/news/top-5-swift-videos-of-2014/)
* A reading club such as [a NoSQL summer](http://nosqlsummer.org/)
* Content should communicate that GitLab is ahead of other tools (CI, etc.), it is the cool new thing, a better product with a better community
* Milk [GitLab Flow](http://doc.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html) for more blog posts and video's
* CI for mobile is painful (Gradle files for Android, loads of assets such as Xcode binaries) and the best current option is customizing Jenkins, mobile is a small circle that moves fast, collaborate with leading projects such as [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) for iOS (Sid can contract [Eloy DurÃ¡n](https://twitter.com/alloy) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for Android to create a great CI experience and blog about it
* Can accellerate the above with free CI runners
* Offer $100 per blog post and use a public issue tracker to gather idea's and tag them as acceptable.
* Encourage guest posts on our blog

## Stories

* Customer stories 'why we choose GitLab'
* Contributor stories 'why I contribute to GitLab'
* Use case stories 'how we use GitLab'
* Boss stories 'how GitLab enabled innersourcing'
* Inception stories 'how GitLab uses GitLab'
* Adoption stories 'how we switched from SVN to GitLab'

## Training

There seems to be [demand for this](https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/sc/courses/source-code-software-training/gitlab-software-training/victoria/) so start offering scheduled training instead of only [on customer request](https://about.gitlab.com/training/).

## Webinars

* Great source of leads
* Can also be interactive sessions with customers to discuss product direction.

## Events

* People and espacially the CEO should go shaking hands, even at small events.
* If you go talk at small events you'll see that over time you get into bigger ones.
* People that you meet in person are more likely to become evangelists for you.
* Attend conferences, espacially OSCON

## Club

Start a GitLab Club for people that evangelize GitLab, make them a superhero:

1. Find them on Twitter, Stack Overflow, our issue tracker, our commits, our irc channel, etc.
1. These people can get access to swag (coupons for webstore)
1. Access to the company and eachother (via a chat channel)
1. Access to our service engineers (support tokens?)
1. Access to good content (make them feel smarter, GitLab Flow, workflow, patterns)
1. Scholarships (money to sponsor and attend events)
1. Ask them to speak on our behalf and pay for their expenses
1. Use a light CRM system like Salesforce IQ to manage it

## Meetups

* We should have a meetup-in-a-box package where we arrange for:

1. The venue (we find and book it)
1. Food (not only pizza, something healthy too)
1. GitLab swag
1. Walkthroughs (demo scripts)
1. Exclusive content (can make new feature presentations exclusive to meetups for a month)
1. Puzzles (pub quiz style, score points and compete with other cities)
1. Video Q&A with service engineers and.or developers
1. AMA's with CEO/CTO
1. Visit in person if we can
1. Organizers become part of the GitLab Club

The first meetups should be run by ourselves.
If someone managers to have 3 to 4 successive meetups it will live on.
Dead meetup cities will be much harder to start up again than new ones.
So do everthing to keep it going.

## Swag

* Should do it in a way that doesn't cost us a lot of time to execute => self serve => web shop
* With a webshop you can just give people credit, they can pick what they want and provide shipping info
* Have lots of mugs, mugs are a conversational item in the office

## Partners

1. Have marque projects move to GitLab by engaging with them, offering support and free licenses
1. Have other tools add support for GitLab
1. Have other tools contribute for their tool to GitLab and have them add themselves on the [application page](https://about.gitlab.com/applications/)
1. Companies using GitLab as part of their application such as O'Reilly and Perforce
