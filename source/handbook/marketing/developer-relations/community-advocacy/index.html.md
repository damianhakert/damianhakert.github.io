## Finding the Community Advocates

- [**Public Issue Tracker**, as part of the Marketing team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues/); please use confidential issues for topics that should only be visible to team members at GitLab)
- [**Chat channel**](https://gitlab.slack.com/archives/community-advocacy); please use the `#community-advocacy` chat channel for questions that don't seem appropriate to use the issue tracker for.

## Role of Community Advocacy

**Ultimate Goal: respond to every community question about GitLab asked online**

- This includes helping members of the community with _their_ questions, but also making sure that the community is heard and that the feedback from the community reaches the rest of the team at GitLab.
- Engage with the developer community in a way that is direct but friendly and authentic. Be able to carry the tone of the GitLab brand while also giving the proper answers or direction to members of the community.
- Help update the [social media guidelines](/handbook/marketing/social-media-guidelines/) and GitLab voice as new situations arise.
- Work with leadership to find a way to track and measure response time across all channels with the ideal response time being under 1 hour for all channels by the end of Q1, 2017.
- Explore different tools from Zendesk to Mentions to find a way to track all mentions of GitLab across the internet.
- Donâ€™t be afraid of animated gifs and well-placed humor! We are not robots.
- Work within the GitLab process to help users report bugs, make feature requests, contact support, and provide feedback to the product.


## Mentions

We use the [mentions-of-gitlab](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/mentions-of-gitlab/) slack channel to track mentions of GitLab across multiple sources. This allows us to respond to user requests across various platforms.

We currently track the following sources for GitLab mentions:

1. Product Hunt
2. Tumblr
3. Hacker News
4. Reddit

We use [notify.ly](https://notify.ly/)  to track and pipe these mentions to the mentions-of-gitlab channel.

We also funnel all comments on our [blog posts](https://about.gitlab.com/blog-posts) and any mention of GitLab on [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) to this channel using [zapier](https://zapier.com/).

## Specific channels

Respond to the GitLab community across the following channels in a timely manner:

- Disqus
- Twitter (via Zendesk, to enable tracking metrics on response times),
- Mailing List
- Facebook
- [forum.gitlab.com](https://forum.gitlab.com)
- StackOverflow
- Reddit
- Quora
- Google alerts
- Hacker News
- Comments on news stories in the media, and ....
- .... more.

### Disqus

_TODO: improve the process of responding to blog comments, probably by disabling the integration with Zendesk and finding a better way to stay alerted._

All the comments from our blog are handled by Disqus. Currently we have an integration in place with Zendesk, where every new
comment or reply to a comment creates a new ticket in ZenDesk. As part of your daily routine, you should
make sure that this queue is as empty as possible. Right now there is no way for us to directly reply to the
comment from ZenDesk, so if a comment you see requires a reply (that is if the ticket is not from someone on
our team, or is a question or a problem) you need to click on the link to the comment and reply directly in
the blog post. Once you have replied, you should come back to ZenDesk and mark that ticket as solved, plus
the ticket that was created for your reply.

### Twitter

Tweets that mention [@GitLab](https://twitter.com/GitLab),
or [@GitLabStatus](https://twitter.com/GitLabStatus), will create a ticket in Zendesk,
and show up in the "Twitter and Facebook" view. All responses should be sent from Zendesk.
If a tweet is responded to from TweetDeck, this risks duplicate responses. Responding
from Zendesk also enables us to track our response times vs. our internal [SLA](/handbook/support/#sla).

Reply to almost all tweets, following the [social media guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/social-media-guidelines/), and the guidelines on [representing GitLab on Twitter](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/#representing-gitlab-on-twitter) regardless of whether the tweet is of a technical nature or not. Follow up with the support team if the issue is too complex to handle.

- The @GitLabStatus account should only be used to give updates on the availability
of GitLab.com and to follow up on users reporting that GitLab.com is unavailable.
- Tweets directed at @GitLabStatus can be answered from the @GitLab account.
- When a tweet mentions 1 or more of the handles described above, it should be replied to from the main handle (@GitLab).
- Tweets use short links which require you to visit that link to make sure you understand the context.
To clarify if the request refers to GitLab or an externally hosted GitLab instance as we can only
handle requests for gitlab.com.
- @GitLabSupport is [a deprecated handle](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues/253) and should not be used.

When resolving Twitter tickets you should:

1. Use [Play mode](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690856-Working-with-tickets#topic_avj_hfg_vt) in the Twitter view. The default Twitter view will sort tickets by created date (ascending).
1. Not skip any tickets
1. Assign the ticket to yourself and ask on the appropriate Slack
   channel if you don't know the answer
1. Not cross assign tickets

### Mailing list

Respond to questions on the [GitLab Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gitlabhq).

_TODO: improve the process of responding to Facebook comments, probably by disabling the integration with Zendesk and finding a better way to stay alerted._

Messages sent to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab/) also feed into ZenDesk.


### GitLab Forum

_TODO: improve the process of responding to forum questions, probably by disabling the integration with Zendesk and finding a better way to stay alerted._

Questions from the [GitLab Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) flow into ZenDesk, but can only be responded to from
within the Forum environment.

### Stack Overflow

_TODO: improve the process of responding to Stack Overflow questions, probably by disabling the integration with Zendesk and finding a better way to stay alerted._

The [Stack Overflow tagged questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gitlab) that relate to GitLab
flow into Zendesk, but can only be responded to from within Stack Overflow.
