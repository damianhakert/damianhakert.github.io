## Markdown Style Guide for about.GitLab.com

This website was generated by [Middleman], a blog-aware Static Site Generator ([SSG]) widely used by web developers.
[Markup language] is part of the structure of any SSG. It is a system to write documents making them somehow
syntactically distinguishable from text. [Lightweight markup languages] have a simplified and unobtrusive syntax,
designed to be easily written within any text editor. That's what we use to write our content. The majority of
SSGs use markdown engines for this purpose. Read through our blog post on [Modern Static Site Generators][ssgs-post] to understand how they work.

For [about.GitLab.com], we use [Kramdown], which is an advanced markdown engine with a lot of interesting features that
most of the other engines don't have.

If you never have written a single line in markdown markup, don't worry, it's easy to learn and even easier to use. You'll
probably be surprised how handy it is once you get used to it. And you'll miss it when the tech you're using doesn't support
markdown.

In most of GitLab text areas you'll find markdown support. Not all of them run with Kramdown, so the markup will not
behave equally "GitLabwide". For **GitLab.com**, **GitLab CE** and **GitLab EE** text areas, the markdown engine is currently
[Redcarpet](http://git.io/ld_NVQ). Here you can find the [markdown style guide][gitlab-markdown] for them.

This guide has been made to make it easier for everyone to use Kramdown features and save a lot of time writing content for
[about.GitLab.com], including handbook pages, website pages, blog posts and everything else within the project [www-GitLab-com].

There are different possible syntaxes for most of the markups described below, but this guide is to be considered the
standard for about.GitLab.com.

## Headings

```md
## Heading h2

### Heading h3

#### Heading h4
```

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
## Heading h2
{:.no_toc style="margin-top:0"}

### Heading h3
{:.no_toc}

#### Heading h4
{:.no_toc}
</div>
</div>

Notes:

- Usually we don't use `h1` headings, as they already are displayed on every page as their titles.
- Always leave a blank space between the hash markup `#` and the text next to it, otherwise it won't render properly.

----

## Paragraphs, breaks and horizontal lines

Regular paragraphs are just lines with text. If you hit enter between two lines, both lines will be joined in a single paragraph.
If you leave a blank line between two lines of text, they will split in two paragraphs.

### Regular paragraphs and automatic join

```md
This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.

</div>
</div>

_**Note:** We usually break the lines within paragraphs to facilitate reviews. Do not leave blank spaces after the last
word of the line broken within a paragraph, unless you want it to be intentionally broken with a `<br>`._

<!-- REPHRASE THIS ^^ OR REMOVE IT COMPLETELY -->

### Additional breaks

In case you need an additional break, you can simply use `<br>`, leaving blank lines above and below it:

```html
Text A
<!-- blank line -->
<br>
<!-- blank line -->
Text B
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Text A

<br>

Text B

</div>
</div>

### Horizontal lines

A sequence of three or more dashes will produce a horizontal line, but let's use always four as standard. Leave blank
lines after and before it:

```html
Text
<!-- blank line -->
----
<!-- blank line -->
Text
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Text

----

Text

</div>
</div>

----

## Emphasis: bold and italic

To display bold or italic text, wrap it into stars or underlines:

```md
This is **bold** and this is _italic_.
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

This is **bold** and this is _italic_.

</div>
</div>

----

## Links

There are a few different ways to display links with markdown markup, but
to keep some standards, let's try to use the following options only.

Place the identifiers at the end of the file, arrange them in alphabetical order.
You can group them in different categories, if that's the case. Check
[this post][ssgs-post-raw] for reference. It's important to organize the links in certain
order to be easy and quick to find them for both the author and the reviewers.


```md
[Text to display][identifier] will display a link.

[Another text][another-identifier] will do the same. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

[Link] will do the same as well.

<https://example.com> works too, best for explicit links.

... (page content) ...

<!-- Identifiers, in alphabetical order -->

[another-identifier]: https://example.com "This example has a title"
[identifier]: http://example1.com
[link]: http://example2.com

```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

[Text to display][identifier] will display a link.

[Another text][another-identifier] will do the same. Hover the mouse over it to see the title.

[Link] will do the same as well.

<https://example.com> works too, best for explicit links.

... (page content) ...

<!-- Identifiers, in alphabetical order -->

[another-identifier]: https://example.com "This example has a title"
[identifier]: http://example1.com
[link]: http://example2.com

</div>
</div>

Notes:

- Identifiers are not case sensitive.
- Avoid using other markup syntax for links.
- Don't take it as a restrictive rule, but avoid using meaningless texts for links as "this article" or "read here". For these examples, it would be better using "the article's title" or "the documentation on the tool".

<!-- explanation can be improved ^^ -->

## Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists are very straight-forward to write. There are a few ways
to produce the same results, but let's stick with the following, again, to maintain
some standards.

Always use three blank spaces to indent a nested list (to create sub items).

Tip: don't leave blank lines between the items, unless you have a reason to do so.

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are pretty easy to create. Couldn't be more intuitive:

```md
1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
   3. Sub item three
2. Item two
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
   3. Sub item three
2. Item two

</div>
</div>


### Unordered lists

Unordered lists are very easy to create too:

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Sub item 1
   - Sub item 2
- Item 4
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Sub item 1
   - Sub item 2
- Item 4

</div>
</div>

### Split lists

Let's say, for some reason, you want to split a list in different parts. To do that, use the
markup `^` to indicate the end of a list and the beginning of the next:

```md
- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
   - sub item 1
   - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
^
- list two - item A
- list two - item A
^
- list three - item _i_
- list three - item _ii_
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}


<div class="panel-body">

- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
   - sub item 1
   - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
^
- list two - item A
- list two - item A
^
- list three - item _i_
- list three - item _ii_

</div>
</div>

## Images

To insert images to your markdown file, use the markup `![ALT](/path/image.ext)`. The path can either be relative to the website, or a full URL for an external image. The supported formats are `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`. You might be able to use some `.svg` files too, depending on
its structure.

```md
![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Image Title")
```

You can also use an identifier, as we do for [links](#links):

```md
![An awesome example image][identifier]
```

If you want to add a caption to your image, it's easily achieved with:

```md
![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png)*My caption*
```

For clickable images, simply wrap the image markup into a [link markup](#links):

```md
[![An awesome example image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Hello World")*My caption*][about.gitlab.com]
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

[![An awesome example image](/images/about-gitlab-com.png "hello world")*My caption*][about.gitlab.com]

</div>
</div>

Notes:

- All images must be placed under `/source/images/`, in an appropriate directory. Only screenshots and public domain images are permitted.
- The text inside the square brackets is an image attribute called `ALT`, which stands for _alternative text_. It [should not be left empty][img-seo], but contain something to describe that image. `ALT` is useful for visually impaired internauts, for SEO, and it is displayed when, for some reason, that image is not loaded by the browser. 
- For the same reasons, the image must contain a name referencing to it. Example: instead of `image-01.jpg`, name it `black-dog.jpg`, if it's a photo of a black dog.

## Videos

<style>
.video_container {
   position: relative;
   padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 - this is responsive by adjusting the hight according to the width! */
   padding-top: 0px;
   height: 0;
}

.video_container iframe {
   position: absolute;
   top: 0;
   left: 0;
   width: 100%;
   height: 100%;
}

.video_container video {
   position: absolute;
   top: 0;
   left: 0;
   width: 100%;
   height: 100%;
}
</style>

<!-- IT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY ADD THESE STYLES ^^ TO OUR CSS, OTHERWISE VIDEOS WON'T BE RESPONSIVE! WELL, NOT PROPORTIONALLY RESPONSIVE. -->

There are two ways of displaying videos: within HTML5 `<video>` tags and within `<iframe>` tags.

### Display videos from YouTube

This method works for YouTube videos and any other embed video within an `<iframe>` tag.

1. Copy the code below and paste it into your markdown file. Leave a blank line above and below it
1. Go the video URL you want to display
1. Click on "Share", then "Embed"
1. Copy the `<iframe>` source (`src`) URL and paste it replacing the `src` below

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
</div>
</div>

### Display other videos

This method works for any video uploaded to somewhere retrievable from the internet from a URL, or from a relative
path like `path/to/video.mp4`.

1. Read through the [w3schools HTML5 video guide][w3-video].
1. Record or export the video in these three formats to achieve cross-browser and cross-device compatibility: `.mp4`, `.ogg` and `.webm`.
1. Get the URL for your video
1. Choose an image to use as a poster
1. Copy the code below and paste it to your file
1. Replace the `src` URLs for your video URLs

```html
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="path/to/poster_image.png">
    <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm">
  </video> 
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">
<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="/images/default-blog-image.png">
    <source src="html5-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video> 
</figure>
</div>
</div>

_**Note:** in case you don't have all formats recommended by w3schools, you can use just one of them, but your video most
likely won't be supported in all devices and browsers. The video above (`.mp4` only) works on Mozilla Firefox for OS X, Android and Windows, and on Chrome for Android and for Windows. Does not work on Chrome for OS X and iOS, neither on Safari. The best option for most cases is using YouTube or Vimeo._

## Table of Contents (ToC)

With Kramdown, creating a Table of Contents is the easiest thing ever! The automatic ToC will include every heading in
the document, unless you don't want it to be included. You do not need to add anchors individually to every title. This is
an automated process.

```md
----

## On this page
{:.no_toc}

- TOC
{:toc}

----
```

As always, leave a blank line before and after the markup. Note that there are four dashes beginning and closing the block, which
is not required, but recommendable for keeping the same standards through about.GitLab.com.

The heading "On this page" can be adapted to your case, e.g., "On this tutorial", or "On this guide", etc.

The markup `{:.no_toc}` is used every time you don't want to include a heading into the ToC. Just add it right above the heading,
and it won't be included into the ToC. In fact this is a [custom class](#classes-ids-and-attributes), as described later in this guide.

The **output** can be found at the very beginning of this page.

----

## Tables

Tables for markdown are challenging. So, we have two approaches: use markdown markup whenever possible, but if you need pretty
advanced table's layouts, you are free to add the HTML markup instead.

The following table has a header (first line), then markup to define the desired alignment, then the table body. You can go forward
and add a separator to use a second and a third table body.

However you prepare your table, its design will depend upon on the CSS styles defined for them.

The last markup `{: .custom-class #custom-id}` **can** be used in case you want to attribute to the `<table>` element a [custom class
and/or a custom ID](#classes-ids-and-attributes).

```md
| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part | Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     | foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      | quux         | baz             | bar            |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Second body     |              |                 |                |
| 2nd line        |              |                 |                |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Third body      |              |                 | Foo            |
{: .custom-class #custom-id}

```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part | Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     | foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      | quux         | baz             | bar            |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Second body     |              |                 |                |
| 2nd line        |              | Hello World     |                |
|-----------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Third body      |              |                 | Foo            |
{: .custom-class #custom-id}

</div>
</div>

<style>
blockquote {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #666;
  font-style: italic;
}
</style>

<!-- ANOTHER CHANGE NECESSARY TO ADD TO CSS ^^ -->

Certain tools can help you to create your own complex table if you need merging lines or columns, and more advanced layouts.
This is a [Table Generator] that perhaps can help you out.

Note that the bars, spaces and dashes were used symmetrically above just for providing a nice view of the table markup. The symmetry
is not required.

Read through the [Kramdown syntax guide][kram-tables] on tables for further information.

> Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. ([Daring Fireball][daring-quote])
{: #quote}

Markdown has not been created to replace HTML, so there are situations we can't run from using HTML. With complex tables,
thats the case.

----

## Code blocks

There are a few options for displaying code blocks with Kramdown:

_In-line_

This is an ``` `in-line` ``` code block.

_Fenced_

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

_Fenced Highlighted_

    ```ruby
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

or

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```
    {: .language-ruby}

_Indented (add 4 white spaces before every line)_

        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end

_Indented Highlighted_

        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end
    {: .language-ruby}


_Nested (add 4 white spaces before every line)_

        ```
        def hello
           puts "Hello world!"
        end
        ```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">


_In-line_

This is an `in-line` code block.

_Fenced_

```
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```

_Fenced Highlighted_

```ruby
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```

or

```
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```
{: .language-ruby}


_Indented_

    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end

_Indented Highlighted_

    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
{: .language-ruby}

_Nested_

    ```
    def hello
       puts "Hello world!"
    end
    ```

</div>
</div>

----

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are good resources to mentioning someone else's quotes, like we did [just above](#quote). Also, can be use to emphasize a sentence or a small
paragraph.

```md
> This is a blockquote. 
>     On multiple lines.
That may be lazy.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

----

> This is a paragraph.
>
> > A nested blockquote.
>
> ### Headers work
>
> * lists too
>
> and all other block-level **elements**.
>
> Even code blocks:
>
>     ruby -e 'puts :works'
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

> This is a blockquote. 
>     On multiple lines.
That may be lazy.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

----

> This is a paragraph.
>
> > A nested blockquote.
>
> ### Headers work 
> {:.no_toc}
>
> * lists too
>
> and all other block-level **elements**.
>
> Even a code block:
>
>     ruby -e 'puts :works'

</div>
</div>

----

## Notes

### Notes for regular pages

```md
_**Note:** this is a note, which is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context._
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_**Note:** this is a note, which is something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context._

</div>
</div>

### Notes for **blog posts**

```md
**Note:** this is a note: something that needs to be mentioned but is apart from the context.
{: .note}
```

The output will be similar to the notes on regular pages, just the font color will be a little lighter, and
the font size, a little smaller. 

----

## Comments

_Markdown markup_

```md
This is a paragraph
{::comment}
This is a comment which is
completely ignored.
{:/comment}
... paragraph continues here.
```

_Regular HTML markup_

    <!-- This is accepted as a comment too -->
{: .language-html}

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

This is a paragraph
{::comment}
This is a comment which is
completely ignored.
{:/comment}
... paragraph continues here.

<!-- This is accepted as a comment too -->

</div>
</div>

----

## Anchors

Add an anchor anywhere with:

```
[](){: name="hello-world"}

Some text
```

Or simply use an ID:

```
Some text
{: #hello-world}
```
----

## Font Awesome

Yes, we can use fancy [Font Awesome] icons too.

_Regular_

```
### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece" aria-hidden="true"></i> Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle}
```

And you can go further, such as the following.

_Styled_

_

```
### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece fa-fw" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Purple Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle-purple}
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

_Regular_

### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece" aria-hidden="true"></i> Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle}

_Styled_

### <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece fa-fw" style="color:rgb(107,79,187); font-size:.85em" aria-hidden="true"></i> Purple Puzzle Icon
{: #puzzle-purple}

</div>
</div>

When doing something like this to a heading, it's important give it a custom ID (`{: #puzzle}`), otherwise the one
automatically created by Kramdown will sound very awkward.

See live examples [on this post][ssgs-post], used to illustrate the text.

-----

## Classes, IDs and attributes

Defining CSS classes, and elements IDs and attributes with markdown is definitely something unusual (Kramdown magic!).

But yes, if you know how to use it, you'll love it! Check how easy it is to do that with Kramdown:

```
Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 .class-2}

Paragraph
{: #custom-id}

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-1}

## Heading
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-2}

Paragraph
{: .class #custom-id-3 style="padding-top:0" key="value"}

## Heading {#hello}

List:

- {: .class} List item with custom class
- {:#id} List item with custom id

To a [link]{: #link}, in-line.

This is a [link]{:hreflang="es"} in Spanish.
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 .class-2}

Paragraph
{: #custom-id}

Paragraph
{: .class .class-1 #custom-id-1}

### Heading
{: .class .class-1 .no_toc #custom-id-2}

Paragraph
{: .class #custom-id-3 style="padding-top:0" key="value"}

### Heading {#hello}
{: .no_toc}

List:

- {: .class} List item with custom class
- {:#id} List item with custom id

To a [link]{: #link}, in-line.

This is a [link]{:hreflang="es"} in Spanish.

</div>
</div>

## Mix HTML + Markdown Markup

This is something unthinkable to someone used to regular markdown. And it's all over this document!

Use the following markup at the beginning of your document:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
```

And feel free to mix everything up:

```
Something in **markdown**

<p>Then an HTML tag with crazy **markup** _all over_ the place!</p>
```

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

<div class="panel-body">

Something in **markdown**

<p>Then an HTML tag with crazy **markup** _all over_ the place!</p>

</div>
</div>

You can close the markup parser tag at any point, if you want to:

```md
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
```

### Styles

To wrap up, guess what?

This:

```css
<style>
  .purple {
    color:rgb(107,79,187);
  }
</style>
```

<style>
  .purple {
    color:rgb(107,79,187);
  }
</style>

Plus:

```
Yes, I'm purple!
{: .purple}
```

Equals to:

<div class="panel panel-info">

**Output**
{: .panel-heading}

## Tips &amp; Tricks

- Avoid leaving double blank spaces between words, or leaving more blank spaces than the necessary, they can cause render differently of the expected.
- Always jump a line from one markup to another.
- If you are confused about a markup that you find in this file, check its [`raw`] for reference.
