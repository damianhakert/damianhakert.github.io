## Introduction

The philosophy for Developer Marketing at GitLab is to help bring insider
knowledge and implicit practice to the hands of developers getting acquainted
with GitLab.

We want to meet each developer where they are now, and help them be the most
efficient they can be with our tools. We want to help their teams realize their creative and collaborative goals.

We also want to address the whole organization, whether they are technical or non-technical; at the coal-face of development or in decision making roles. GitLab is not only used for code development and review. Those same tools are used by team members to track progress, create documentation and collaborate on projects.

## 2016 activities

- Publish an active [blog](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-marketing/blog/) with useful content relevant to GitLab users.
- Publish a twice-monthly email newsletter you can sign up to on [our contact page](https://about.gitlab.com/contact/).
- Host [webcasts](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-marketing/webcasts/) which welcome newcomers, celebrate with existing users, and provide access to expertise. These are great source of leads. Some can be interactive sessions with customers to discuss product direction.
