## Field Marketing

Field marketing includes event marketing and swag production.  

## Events Overview

* People and especially the CEO should go shaking hands, even at small events.
* If you go talk at small events you'll see that over time you get into bigger ones.
* People that you meet in person are more likely to become evangelists for you.
* Attend conferences, especially OSCON.
* Get GitLab team members out to meet people in the community.

## Events Goals
- Evangelism (brand) - Talk to as many people as we can about GitLab. Our booth presence we must be friendly, knowledgeable, and outgoing. 
- Sales leads (revenue) - We will collect business cards and email addresses for potential leads. 
- Hiring (company) - Always be recruiting. See someone doing a great job of evangelism for another product? Ask that person for coffee.
- Partnership (channel) - Organizations adding support for GitLab and/or shipping GitLab with their offering.
- Product Direction - what is the market asking for, in need of and willing to pay for.  
- Drive audience to any talks/ events we are having

## How We Evaluate Events
- Price/ Budget 
- Location- tops cities for developers and can we tag on another event?
- Attendees- whoâ€™s attending? Is it the right audience for us? entrepreneurs vs engineers 
- Size- go bigger
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- We want to strike a good balance between: community and enterprise events.

## Promoting Events
- Email signatures- starting 1 month before event???
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects
- BDRS will help set up 20 in person meetings set up before event to occur at event


## After and Event

- Fill out after event survey- send any relevant feedback on event to marketing event staff. 
    - was the event valuable?
        - would you go again/ should we go again?
        - did we get good leads/ contacts?
        - best questions asked and conversations
        - was our sponsorship/ involvement successful?
    - how was the booth set up?
        - how was the booth staffing?
        - did the booth get enough traffic?
        - booth location and size
    - how did our swag go over?
        - did we have enough/ too much?
    - contests?
- Make sure contacts/ leads gathered from event are with marketing and categorized under specific event campaign.
- Follow up with leads from event within 5 business days after event ends.


## Speaker Portal

* Catalogue of talks and speaker briefs we have done or can do and their run times.  Contact community@gitlab.com for access.

## Meetups

* We have a meetup-in-a-box package where we arrange for:

1. Food (not only pizza, something healthy too)
1. GitLab swag
1. Walkthroughs (demo scripts)
1. Exclusive content (can make new feature presentations exclusive to meetups for a month)
1. Puzzles (pub quiz style, score points and compete with other cities)
1. Video Q&A with service engineers and.or developers
1. AMA's with CEO/CTO
1. Visit in person if we can
1. Organizers become part of the GitLab Club

The first meetups should be run by ourselves.
If someone manages to have 3 to 4 successive meetups it will live on.
Dead meetup cities will be much harder to start up again than new ones.
So do everything to keep it going.

## Swag

* We aim to do swag in a way that doesn't cost us a lot of time to execute => self serve => [web shop](https://gitlab.mybrightsites.com/)
* With a webshop you can just give people credit, they can pick what they want and provide shipping info.
* Of course we have [stickers](http://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-source-stickers). Also working on special edition stickers for contributors, GitLab Club members.
* We aim to make our sag delight an or be useful.
* Making limited edition swag for the community to collect.
