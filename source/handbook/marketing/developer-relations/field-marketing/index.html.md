## **Field Marketing**

Field marketing includes event marketing and swag production.  

## Events Overview<a name="events"></a>

* Get GitLab team members out to meet people in the community. People that you meet in person are more likely to become evangelists for you.
* If you go talk at small events you'll see that over time you get into bigger ones.

## Events Goals<a name="goals"></a>
- Evangelism (brand) - Talk to as many people as we can about GitLab. Our booth presence we must be friendly, knowledgeable, and outgoing.
- Sales leads (revenue) - We will collect business cards and email addresses for potential leads.
- Hiring (company) - Always be recruiting. See someone doing a great job of evangelism for another product? Ask that person for coffee.
- Partnership (channel) - Organizations adding support for GitLab and/or shipping GitLab with their offering.
- Product Direction - discovery of what the market asking for, in need of and willing to pay for.  
- Drive audience to any talks/ events we are having.

## How We Evaluate Events<a name="evaluate"></a>
- Price/ Budget
- Location- tops cities for developers and can we tag on another event?
- Attendees- who’s attending? Is it the right audience for us? entrepreneurs vs engineers.
- Size- try to reach a large audience.
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- Can we pair this event with other local engagements?
- We want to strike a good balance between: community and enterprise events.

## For GitLab Employees<a name="promotion"></a>
- If there is an event you would like to attend, are attending, speaking or have proposed a talk please let the Field Marketing Manager know. We will try to support you attending the event in any way we can. Even if we are unable to sponsor the event you can likely still attend with your managers approval. 
- Remember we are way more likely to sponsor an event if you have solidified a speaking spot. So, if there is something you really want to attend propose a talk. 
- Calls for papers are posted in the CFP Channel on Slack. 
- If you do not have any GitLab swag and are going to an event, notify the Field Marketing Manager as soon as possible so we can try and get you a GitLab shirt to wear.

## Promoting Events<a name="promotion"></a>
- Use social media to post as soon as committed to attending an event.
- Email signatures- starting 1 month before event for those attending event.
- Monthly blog post about upcoming events at the first of the month.

## Pre Event Outreach<a name="promotion"></a>
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects before event.
- If there is not an attendee list do "warm" outreach to prospects- create email campaign based on location. Send one email 1.5 weeks before event.
- BDRS will help set up in person meetings to occur at event.

## Complete Before Event<a name="promotion"></a>
- Set up post event follow up campaigns in Marketo.
- After Event Survey created and email template ready to go out first work day back after event. Includes details on lead followup and how to add business card details. 
- Social media to go out during event scheduled. 
- Plan for what to do with any remaining swag. 

## **At Events**

## Employee Booth Guidelines<a name="guidelines"></a>

- If you see someone standing alone, talk to them.
- Do not stand around and talk to other GitLab coworkers. Talk to people you don’t know.
- Do not sell; generate interest to learn more. Attendees have a lot of info they are digesting, so get their info and some key info to follow up on.
- Give out swag and one-pagers!
- Don’t be afraid to walk around to other booths and talk to people. Make friends we could partner with, create interesting content with, or just have friendly beers.
- The booth should be clean and organized at all times.
- Document any product feedback you get.
- If press comes to the event feel free to put them in contact with CEO (Sid) or Marketing (Ashley).
- Bring your business cards and a plan to take notes on encounters.

## Networking Tips<a name="networking"></a>

## Speaker Portal<a name="speakerportal"></a>

* Catalogue of talks and speaker briefs we have done or can do and their run times.  Contact community@gitlab.com for access.

## Meetups<a name="meetups"></a>

- Ideally first meetups should be run by GitLab employees. If someone manages to have 3-4 successive events, the meetup itself will live on. It is much harder to start new meetups versus maintaining existing ones. So we should everything to keep existing events going.
- We love to attend others meetup groups. If you would like someone from the GitLab team to stop by your event please email community@gitlab.com.
