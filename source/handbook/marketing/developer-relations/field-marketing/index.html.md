## **Field Marketing**

Field marketing includes event marketing and swag production.  

## Events Overview

* Get GitLab team members out to meet people in the community. People that you meet in person are more likely to become evangelists for you.
* If you go talk at small events you'll see that over time you get into bigger ones.

## Events Goals
- Evangelism (brand) - Talk to as many people as we can about GitLab. Our booth presence we must be friendly, knowledgeable, and outgoing.
- Sales leads (revenue) - We will collect business cards and email addresses for potential leads.
- Hiring (company) - Always be recruiting. See someone doing a great job of evangelism for another product? Ask that person for coffee.
- Partnership (channel) - Organizations adding support for GitLab and/or shipping GitLab with their offering.
- Product Direction - discovery of what the market asking for, in need of and willing to pay for.  
- Drive audience to any talks/ events we are having.

## How We Evaluate Events
- Price/ Budget
- Location- tops cities for developers and can we tag on another event?
- Attendees- who’s attending? Is it the right audience for us? entrepreneurs vs engineers.
- Size- try to reach a large audience.
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- Can we pair this event with other local engagements? 
- We want to strike a good balance between: community and enterprise events.

## Promoting Events
- Use social media to post as soon as committed to attending an event.
- Email signatures- starting 1 month before event for those attending event.
- Monthly blog post about upcoming events.
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects before event.
- BDRS will help set up in person meetings to occur at event.

## **At Events**

## Employee Booth Guidelines

- If you see someone standing alone, talk to them.
- Do not stand around and talk to other GitLab coworkers. Talk to people you don’t know.
- Do not sell; generate interest to learn more. Attendees have a lot of info they are digesting, so get their info and some key info to follow up on.
- Give out swag and one-pagers!
- Don’t be afraid to walk around to other booths and talk to people. Make friends we could partner with, create interesting content with, or just have friendly beers.
- The booth should be clean and organized at all times.
- Document any product feedback you get.
- If press comes to the event feel free to put them in contact with CEO (Sid) or Marketing (Ashley).

## Speaker Portal

* Catalogue of talks and speaker briefs we have done or can do and their run times.  Contact community@gitlab.com for access.

## Meetups

* Devloping meetup-in-a-box package where we will arrange for:

- Food (not only pizza, something healthy too)
- GitLab swag
- Walkthroughs (demo scripts)
- Exclusive content (can make new feature presentations exclusive to meetups for a month)
- Puzzles (pub quiz style, score points and compete with other cities)
- Video Q&A with service engineers and.or developers
- AMA's with CEO/CTO
- Visit in person if we can
- Organizers become part of the GitLab Club (more details to come)

The first meetups should be run by GitLab employees. If someone manages to have 3-4 successive events, the meetup itself will live on. It is much harder to start new meetups versus maintaining existing ones. So we should everything to keep existing events going.

## Swag

* We aim to have our swag delight and or be useful.
* We aim to make limited edition swag for the community to collect.
