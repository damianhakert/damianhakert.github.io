## Inbound Lead Flow<a name="leadFlow"></a>

1. Lead comes into BDR team via one of the named Inbound Lead routes above.
1. Lead is input into Marketo.
1. Lead is assigned according to assignment rules.
1. If region is EMEA, lead goes directly to EMEA BDR team.
1. If region is APAC, lead goes directly to APAC Sales Director.
1. All other regions go directly to NA BDR team.
1. All other leads pass through BDR lead qualification process.

## Lead qualification process<a name="leadQual"></a>

1. Unless a specific request is made, provide a useful resource that will help the person have a better GitLab experience.
2. Ask [Discovery Questions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales-qualification-questions/) to qualify lead
3. Soft-BANT is used to determine if a lead should be passed to sales or recommended CE resources. Once determined, BDR team passes all leads to sales for followup via Salesforce assignment and email notification.
4. If 2 of the 4 elements of BANT are met (budget, authority, need, timeline), BDR team will determine account owner and pass lead.
5. If further qualification is needed to understand Soft-BANT requirements, BDR team will email or schedule a phone call with lead to understand their project and initiatives.
6. If Soft-BANT isn't met and there are questions, BDR team will answer all questions or route to support.
7. If there are no questions and lead isn't qualified yet, the lead status is updated appropriately. See "lead status" above.
8. If a lead is from a [Fortune 500 company](http://fortune.com/fortune500/), it will be assigned to a senior account executive.  For larger opportunities outside the US, lead will be passed to senior account executive or sales director in region.
9. If a lead is an existing customer or a prospect that's owned/operated by an existing customer, BDR team will determine account owner and pass lead.
10. If a lead is from a company that is already in Salesforce, BDR team will determine account owner and pass lead.

## Soft-BANT<a name="bant"></a>

- Budget => Does the person work at a company that could afford GitLab (i.e. has revenue or funding)?
- Authority => Can the person influence a purchase decision?
- Need => Is there a legitimate use for GitLab at the company (i.e. multiple developers, etc.)?
- Timeline => Are they willing to continue communicating about GitLab in the next few weeks? If they have another solution, are they looking to replace in the next few weeks or months?

## What counts as an SQL or MQL?<a name="SQL"></a>
* SQL is any lead which has been both:
    * accepted by the sales team which has met the qualification requirements, and
    * converted to a Contact in SFDC and attached to a new Opportunity in SFDC.

        => when converting a qualified lead, make sure that you are creating an opportunity upon conversion. This is required to map the BDR to the opportunity.  It also helps us to track the age of an opportunity from discovery call to closed.

        => if the lead is not a new opportunity, convert to a contact and uncheck the box to create a new opportunity.
* MQL is any lead with a lead score of 20 or greater in Marketo (lead score is calculated based on behavioral and demographic data). Some examples of bahavior or demographic data that increase lead score are:
   * Signing up to receive the newsletter (behavioral)
   * Signing up for an account on gitlab.com (behavioral)
   * Filling out other web forms (contacts us, webinar registration, etc) (behavioral)
   * Starting an EE Trial (behavioral)
   * Working at a Fortune 500 (demographic)
   * Job title (demographic)

## Lead status<a name="leadStatus"></a>

- Raw => Newly synced lead from Marketo to SFDC
- Open => Lead not yet contacted
- Attempt 1 => One message sent without response; after 21 days, auto-updates to Nurture
- Attempt 2 => Two messages sent without response; after 21 days, auto-updates to Nurture
- Attempt 3 => Three messages sent without response; after 21 days, auto-updates to Nurture
- Attempt 4 => Four messages sent without response; after 21 days, auto-updates to Nurture
- Qualified => Soft-BANT criteria met. Action: pass to sales team.
- Progressing => Communication is two-way, but Soft-BANT still undetermined. Any response that doesn't immediately put the lead into "Qualified", "Unqualified", or "Nurture" status should put the lead in this status.
- Unqualified => Soft-BANT criteria not met (e.g. a developer using GitLab for personal projects, a student, etc.). Action: send appropriate resources if requested; avoid sending salesy messages.
- Bad Data => Invalid email address. Note: only mark as bad data if there is no communication channel. For example, a lead who provided "Spam Spamson" as their name but still provided a valid email address is not Bad Data.
- Nurture => May become "Qualified" in the future, but communication is closed. Will receive useful marketing emails.

##Passing Qualified Leads<a name="leadPassing"></a>
- Set "Lead Status" to Qualified and assign the appropriate sales team member as the new owner
- Introduce the lead to the sales team member unless inappropriate or unnecessary.
- If no action is taken by the newly assigned sales team member within 1-7 days, follow up with them and determine why no action has been taken.

## Nurture campaign process<a name="nurture"></a>

Coming soon once process is defined. Will be signup campaign for GitLab.com, leads that don't meet Soft-BANT requirements, etc.

## Subscriptions and Newsletter<a name="newsletter"></a>

Inbound leads receive appropriate marketing emails, such as newsletters, onboarding tips (coming soon), etc. What they receive depends on how they came to find us and what we believe will be most helpful to them. For example, a person who downloaded an EE trial will receive different resources than a person who registered for a webcast. Our non-operational emails have a one-click unsubscribe button. You can manually unsubscribe a person by clicking the "Opt Out" checkbox in SFDC. SFDC also has a manual 30-Day Opt Out checkbox for a 30-day unsubscribe from non-operational emails.

## Inbound Leads<a name="inbound"></a>

3. Lead is assigned based on current account owner.
4. If no current account owner, Emily handles.

## Marketo Tools Server<a name="marketoTools"></a>

- This is a simple Sinatra application that receives several webhooks and forwards the relevant information to Marketo via its REST API.
- URL: http://marketo-tools.gitlap.com/ (can't access via browser)
- [Software running on it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketo-tools/)
- [Readme of the cookbook for deployment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/cookbook-marketo-tools/blob/master/README.md)

## Sales and Community Group Emails<a name="groupEmail"></a>

- Always CC or BCC the group email list (sales@gitlab.com or community@gitlab.com) so others on the list know it's been handled.
- If a request is a new lead with questions about EE, pricing, etc., handle directly.
- If an email is a quote, forward to appropriate sales people.
- If an email is a refund or other billing request, forward to ar@gitlab.com.
- If an email is a license issue or question, forward to support@gitlab.com.
- If an email is received(contact request, account questions, etc. etc.), check in sfdc if there is an account owner. If there is, forward the email to the owner and change the case into their name if there is an open case. If the account owner is Chad or Hank, this is the default. Forward all inquiries/requests to Chad and he will take care of them. Also switch the sfdc case into Chad's name as well.

## Newsletters<a name="newsletters"></a>
