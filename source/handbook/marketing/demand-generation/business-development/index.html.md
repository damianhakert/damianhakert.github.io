#### Frequently Asked Questions<a name="questions"></a>

How do I get help/assistance?

- Don't hesitate to ping one of your colleagues with a question, or someone on the team who specializes in what you you're searching for. Everyone is happy to help, and it's better to get your work done faster with your team, than being held up at a road block.

   - Questions specific to:
      - Salesforce (I’m having issues with Salesforce, can’t login, my leads are not syncing, salesforce isn't working, I want to request more contacts from discoverorg, not sure what the protocol is, etc.)
         - Francis Aquino
      - GitLab account (it isn’t working, I can’t seem to login or access anything)
         - Assigned Buddy (during onboarding), #Support channel

What are my work hours?

- The handbook says “You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Any instructions are open to discussion. You don’t have to defend how you spend your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules”

Who should I connect with for my 10 1:1 onboarding calls?

- You can connect with whomever you please. However, you will interact the most with the Sales Team and the Demand Generation Team. * See the [GitLab Team Page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/) for suggestions.

[Additional FAQ's](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1O_DTqnsQaHpqFeA7h24R-ozu0ZeyHey0yNI0GIAA7_w/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Variable Compensation Guidelines<a name="compensation"></a>

Full-time BDRs have a significant portion of their pay based on performance and objective attainment. Performance based "bonuses" are based on results. Actions for obtaining results will be prescribed and measured, but are intentionally left out of bonus attainment calculations to encourage experimentation. BDRs will naturally be drawn to activities that have the highest yield, but freedom to choose their own daily activities will allow new, higher yield activities to be discovered.

Guidelines for bonuses:

- Team and individual objectives are based on GitLab's revenue targets and adjusted monthly.
- Bonuses are paid quarterly.
- Bonuses may be based on various objectives
   - E.g. a new BDR's first month's bonus is typically based on completing [onboarding](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-onboarding/)
   - Bonuses may be tied to sales target attainment, [OKRs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/#okrs), or other objectives.

#### Improvements/Contributing<a name="contribute"></a>

- If you get an answer to a question someone else may benefit from, incorporate it into this handbook or add it to the [FAQ document](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1O_DTqnsQaHpqFeA7h24R-ozu0ZeyHey0yNI0GIAA7_w/edit?usp=sharing)
- After meetings or process changes, feel free to update this handbook, and submit a merge request
- Create issues for any idea (small or large that), that you want feedback on
