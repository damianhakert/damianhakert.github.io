## **Field Marketing**

Field marketing includes event marketing and swag production.

## Events Overview<a name="events"></a>

* Get GitLab team members out to meet people in the community. People that you meet in person are more likely to become evangelists for you.
* If you go talk at small events you'll see that over time you get into bigger ones.

## Event Goals<a name="goals"></a>
- Evangelism (brand) - Talk to as many people as we can about GitLab. Our booth presence we must be friendly, knowledgeable, and outgoing.
- Sales leads (revenue) - We will collect business cards and email addresses for potential leads.
- Hiring (company) - Always be recruiting. See someone doing a great job of evangelism for another product? Ask that person for coffee.
- Partnership (channel) - Organizations adding support for GitLab and/or shipping GitLab with their offering.
- Product Direction - discovery of what the market asking for, in need of and willing to pay for.
- Drive audience to any talks/ events we are having.

## How We Evaluate Events<a name="evaluate"></a>
- Price/ Budget
- Location- tops cities for developers and can we tag on another event?
- Attendees- who’s attending? Is it the right audience for us? entrepreneurs vs engineers.
- Size- try to reach a large audience.
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- Can we pair this event with other local engagements?
- We want to strike a good balance between: community and enterprise events.

## For GitLab Employees<a name="promotion"></a>
- If there is an event you would like to attend, are attending, speaking or have proposed a talk please let the Field Marketing Manager know. We will try to support you attending the event in any way we can. Even if we are unable to sponsor the event you can likely still attend with your managers approval.
- Remember we are way more likely to sponsor an event if you have solidified a speaking spot. So, if there is something you really want to attend propose a talk.
- Calls for papers are posted in the CFP Channel on Slack.
- If you do not have any GitLab swag and are going to an event, notify the Field Marketing Manager as soon as possible so we can try and get you a GitLab shirt to wear.

## Promoting Events<a name="promotion"></a>
- [Use social media](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/social-marketing/#event-promotion) to post as soon as committed to attending an event.
- Email signatures- starting 1 month before event for those attending event.
- Monthly blog post about upcoming events at the first of the month.

## Pre Event Outreach<a name="promotion"></a>
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects before event.
- If there is not an attendee list do "warm" outreach to prospects- create email campaign based on location. Send one email 1.5 weeks before event.
- BDRS will help set up in person meetings to occur at event.

## Complete Before Event<a name="promotion"></a>
- Set up post event follow up campaigns in Marketo.
- After Event Survey created and email template ready to go out first work day back after event. Includes details on lead followup and how to add business card details.
- Social media to go out during event scheduled.
- Plan for what to do with any remaining swag.

## **At Events**

## Employee Booth Guidelines<a name="guidelines"></a>

- If you see someone standing alone, talk to them.
- Do not stand around and talk to other GitLab coworkers. Talk to people you don’t know.
- Do not sell; generate interest to learn more. Attendees have a lot of info they are digesting, so get their info and some key info to follow up on.
- Give out swag and one-pagers!
- Don’t be afraid to walk around to other booths and talk to people. Make friends we could partner with, create interesting content with, or just have friendly beers.
- The booth should be clean and organized at all times.
- Document any product feedback you get.
- If press comes to the event feel free to put them in contact with CEO (Sid) or Marketing (Ashley).
- Bring your business cards and a plan to take notes on encounters.

## Networking Tips<a name="networking"></a>
- Listen.
- Ask questions.
- Don't interrupt.
- Everyone gets shy sometimes, be the brave one and introduce yourself to new people.
- Feel free to talk about our next release, GitLab [strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/), or our [product direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision).

## Speaker Portal<a name="speakerportal"></a>

* Catalogue of talks and speaker briefs we have done or can do and their run times.  Contact community@gitlab.com for access.

## Meetups<a name="meetups"></a>

- Ideally first meetups should be run by GitLab employees. If someone manages to have 3-4 successive events, the meetup itself will live on. It is much harder to start new meetups versus maintaining existing ones. So we should everything to keep existing events going.
- We love to attend others meetup groups. If you would like someone from the GitLab team to stop by your event please email community@gitlab.com.

## Swag<a name="swag"></a>

* We aim to have our swag delight and/ or be useful.
* We aim to make limited edition and themed swag for the community to collect. Bigger events will have custom tanuki stickers in small runs, only available at their specific event.
* We aim to do swag in a way that doesn't take a lot of time to execute => self serve => [web shop](https://gitlab.mybrightsites.com/)
* With a web shop you can just give people credit, they can pick what they want and provide shipping info.
* Of course we love [stickers](http://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-source-stickers). We are working on special edition stickers for contributors to be announced May 2016- being shipped right now.
* We get a lot of requests to send swag, and we try to respond to them all. 
    - Ask about the expected number of attendees, the best shipping address, and if they have a specific order in mind (if they're requesting on behalf of a small meetup group, for example.) If they do not specify, send black unisex tees when in stock.
    - Include the contents of the order, along with the shipping address in an email to our swag store managers. There is no need to add these amounts to the marketing budget spreadsheet because the swag store sends its own report of what was spent. 
    - For orders of stickers in a quantity of 100 or greater, do not go through the swag store but rather use our [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/) account. You will need the same information (address and order quantity). After placing the order, add the amount to the marketing budget spreadsheet. 

## Diversity Sponsorship<a name="diversitysponsorship"></a>

* We offer a $500 [sponsorship](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/02/02/gitlab-diversity-sponsorship/) to any group that aims to improve diversity in tech.
* We receive requests through the [community sponsorship form](https://about.gitlab.com/community/sponsorship/) and to the community @ inbox. 
* After receiving a request for sponsorship, ask for more information if necessary, then ask them to send an invoice with routing information for the appropriate account. 
* After receicing the invoice, send it to ap @ company domain; after it is approved the amount will be sent via direct deposit. 
* If we have a team member in the location of the event, alert them so they have the option to attend. 
* After we have committed to sponsor the event, [schedule a tweet](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/social-marketing/#event-promotion) announcing our involvement and add the amount to the marketing budget spreadsheet.
