# **Field Marketing**

Field marketing includes events, event marketing, sponsorships, and swag production. The role of field marketing is to identify and support critical sales and marketing opportunities through field marketing avenues and to bring the GitLab brand to life. 

## **Events**<a name="events"></a>
If you have any questions please email events@gitlab.com. 

### Event Goals<a name="goals"></a>
- Sales leads (revenue) - Create new growth opportunities. Collect business cards, meet new contacts and potential leads.
- Product Direction - discovery of what the market asking for, in need of and willing to pay for.
- Evangelism (brand) - Talk to as many people as we can about GitLab to drive awareness. Our presence should be friendly, knowledgeable, and genuine. We are all the brand and we want to bring that bran dot life and be memorable.
- Hiring (company) - Always be recruiting. See someone doing a great job of evangelism for another product? Ask that person to grab a coffee.
- Partnership (channel) - Organizations adding support for GitLab and/or shipping GitLab with their offering.
- Drive audience to any talks/ events we are having.

### Event Lifecycle<a name="evaluate"></a>

#### Evaluating Potential Events<a name="evaluate"></a>
- Price/ Budget
- Location- tops cities for developers and can we tag on another event?
- Attendees- who’s attending? Is it the right audience for us? entrepreneurs vs engineers. Will ther ebe decision makers in attendance?
- Size- try to reach a large audience.
- What will our presence be? Who can/ can we go, participate, speak, booth?
- We want to emphasize enterprise events but also remember our Community.

##### For GitLab Employees<a name="promotion"></a>
- If there is an event you would like to attend, are attending, speaking, or have proposed a talk and you would like support from GitLab to attend this event the process goes as follows:
 1. Contact your manager for approval to attend/ speak. 
 1. After getting approval from your manager, please *only request* event support if your engagement fits the following criteria:
		1. The event will further business aims of GitLab (see event goals). Tell us what potential growth opportunities can be gained from investing in this event. 
	    2. The event has an audience of **250+ people** (the exception being meetups- see below for more info on meetups)
	    3. The event is a more than a month away. 
1. If your event fits the criteria above and you would like support from marketing, create an issue in the [marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues) using the Events template. 
1. Fill out any relevant information you have. Someone from Marketing will be in touch about to discuss your request further within one week. 
 1. If your event is approved and sponsored, GitLab will promote your presence at the event and you will be asked follow up on the event. We will need to know how the event went. Was it valuable?  Should we attend again? Specific questions will be address in the issue created.  We would also like a list of any contacts you made at the event. 
- Please note, even if we are unable to sponsor the event you can likely still attend with your managers approval.

##### How we decide who attends which events? 
 * Determine how many staffers we need and if the event is more enterprise focused or community. Enterprise- we try to send more marketing/ sales. Community- send more developers and dev advocates.  
 * See who is in the area who might be a good fit for the target audience.
 * We lean towards those who might be thought leaders, specialists, or more social in that specific sector. 
- Calls for papers are posted in the CFP Channel on Slack. Follow channel for updates on speaking opportunities. 
- If you do not have any GitLab swag and are going to an event, notify the Field Marketing Manager as soon as possible so we can try and get you a GitLab shirt to wear. We generally need about a month of lead time to get anything, even stickers. 


#### Pre-Event<a name="promotion"></a>
##### Promoting Events<a name="promotion"></a>

- Email signatures- starting 1 month before event for those attending event.
- Monthly blog post about upcoming events at the first of the month.
- Get attendee list and contact customers and prospects before event.
- If there is not an attendee list do "warm" outreach to prospects- create email campaign based on location. Send one email 1.5 weeks before event.

#### **At Events**

##### Employee Booth Guidelines<a name="guidelines"></a>

- If you see someone standing alone, talk to them.
- Do not stand around and talk to other GitLab coworkers. Talk to people you don’t know.
- Do not sell; generate interest to learn more. Attendees have a lot of info they are digesting, so get their info and some key info to follow up on.
- Give out swag and and documentation we have!
- Don’t be afraid to walk around to other booths and talk to people. Make friends we could partner with, create interesting content with, or just have friendly beers.
- The booth should be clean and organized at all times.

- If press comes to the event feel free to put them in contact with CEO (Sid) or Marketing.
- Bring your business cards and a plan to take notes on encounters.

##### Suggested Attire<a name="attire"></a>

- Clean, closed-toed shoes please.
- A smile.

## Meetups<a name="meetups"></a>

- We love and support Meetups. If you would like someone from the GitLab team to stop by your event or might be interested in having GitLab as a sponsor please email community@gitlab.com. Please note, we will be much more able to assist if given sufficient lead time (at least a month) to evaluate request, process payment, and produce and swag. 
- GitLab Meetups: Ideally, the first couple meetups should be run by GitLab employees, but once someone manages to have qa couple successive events, the meetup itself will live on. It is much harder to start new meetups versus maintaining existing ones. So we make an effort to support and keep existing events going. 

## Diversity Sponsorship<a name="diversitysponsorship"></a>

* We offer a $500 [sponsorship](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/02/02/gitlab-diversity-sponsorship/) to any group that aims to improve diversity in tech.
* We receive requests through the [community sponsorship form](https://about.gitlab.com/community/sponsorship/) and to the community @ inbox. 
* After receiving a request for sponsorship, ask for more information if necessary, then ask them to send an invoice with routing information for the appropriate account. 
* After receicing the invoice, send it to ap @ company domain; after it is approved the amount will be sent via direct deposit. 
* If we have a team member in the location of the event, alert them so they have the option to attend. 
* After we have committed to sponsor the event, [schedule a tweet](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/social-marketing/#event-promotion) announcing our involvement and add the amount to the marketing budget spreadsheet.  

## Speaker Portal<a name="speakerportal"></a>

* Catalogue of talks and speaker briefs we have done or can do and their run times.  Contact community@gitlab.com for access.

## Swag<a name="swag"></a>

* We aim to have our swag delight and/ or be useful.
* We aim to make limited edition and themed swag for the community to collect. Bigger events will have custom tanuki stickers in small runs, only available at their specific event.
* We aim to do swag in a way that doesn't take a lot of time to execute => self serve => [web shop](https://gitlab.mybrightsites.com/)
* With a web shop you can just give people credit, they can pick what they want and provide shipping info.
* Of course we love [stickers](http://opensource.com/business/15/11/open-source-stickers). We are working on special edition stickers for contributors to be announced May 2016- being shipped right now.
* We get a lot of requests to send swag, and we try to respond to them all. 
    - Ask about the expected number of attendees, the best shipping address, and if they have a specific order in mind (if they're requesting on behalf of a small meetup group, for example.) If they do not specify, send black unisex tees when in stock.
    - Include the contents of the order, along with the shipping address in an email to our swag store managers. There is no need to add these amounts to the marketing budget spreadsheet because the swag store sends its own report of what was spent. 
    - For orders of stickers in a quantity of 100 or greater, do not go through the swag store but rather use our [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/) account. You will need the same information (address and order quantity). After placing the order, add the amount to the marketing budget spreadsheet.
