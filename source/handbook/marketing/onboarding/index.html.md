## Expectations of the marketing team
{: #expectations}

As members of the marketing team we are the first to interact with potential customers and community members.
As such it is up to us to represent the company and make sure we present ourselves properly. Therefore we are
expected to:

- Always be friendly and respectful
- Be open to new ideas and points of view
- It is OK if you don't know something. You can always ask someone else
- It is OK to say no to a customer, but try to suggest a workaround and escalate to a Senior if necessary
- Read the guidelines on how to [respond on social media](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/social-media-guidelines).

## Marketing Bootcamp?
{: #marketing-bootcamp}

When you first join the team everything will be new to you. In order to get you
started with GitLab quickly a [Marketing Bootcamp Checklist](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/onboarding/checklist)
will be created for you to help guide you through your training.

### Point to documentation, or make it
{: #document-it}

As a general rule, you should always include a link to the applicable documentation as
part of your response to a question. If the documentation does not exist yet, then
_make_ the documentation and send the link in the response. 

### Create issues

During your interaction with the customers you will most likely need to create or update an
issue, either for a feature request, for a bug, or for further documentation.
Since we do everything in the open, it is good practice to send the link of the
issue to the requesting customer, so that they can also keep an eye on the discussion
there, and weigh in if necessary.


Workflow for creating an issue:

- Visit the issues page of the project, [CE example here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues)
- Search to make sure the issue doesn't already exist
- Click **New Issue**
- Choose a template from the **Choose a template** dropdown and take a look at the
**Typical kinds of issues created** below.
- Fill in all the relevant sections
- Assign it to someone, choose an expert [here](https://about.gitlab.com/team/) or feel free to ask
in the #support channel on slack who it should be assigned to. Do not worry that you are assigning
someone a job when you don't even know them and they might be much more senior than you,
if it's not appropriate for them, they will know the right person to assign it to and do that.

Typical kinds of issues created:

- 
Typical workflow for updating an existing issue:

1. Comment on the issue that another customer is having a problem, adding relevant details. 


Sometimes it is helpful to create an issue on the [marketing issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues)


Sometimes a customer will send an email to ask for a response to an issue that was
already created on a public issue tracker. In such
cases, include the link to the given issue in the "GitLab Issue" box, go ahead and
reply from the issue tracker, but also follow-up through ZenDesk by providing a link
to your comment in the issue tracker. Providing the response to the customer is
what sets the "first response time" metric, and allows the tickets to be closed
when appropriate.

### When and how to escalate an issue
{: #when-escalate}

Do not hesitate to ask for help with a ticket, you can ask any of your colleagues to assist you. You can do this via
Slack initially by [@mentioning](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205240127-Using-mentions) their name and providing a link to the description with an overview of the issue.
If the person you know can help you the best (expert on a specific topic) is not available on
Slack, you can assign the ticket to them, add a comment summarizing the situation, and submit the
ticket as **open**. Especially if you do are not yet fully familiar with the particular topic of the issue,
don't spend more than 30 minutes on an issue before escalating it internally.

### How to handle emails forwarded from others at GitLab

Every now and then, a GitLab team member will forward a question from a customer, prospective customer, user, etc. Always reply directly to the original requester, keeping the person who forwarded it in the cc. 

## Customer Training 


### Vacation

You are encouraged to take as many vacations days as you need, as per our [handbook](/handbook). There
are, however, some things to consider when a member of the support team takes a vacation.

**On-call schedule must be covered**

Before leaving for vacation, 2 weeks before at the latest, you should coordinate with your colleagues
to see who can take over the days when you should be on-call. This can happen via an issue in our
[Organization Repo](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues?label_name=pagerduty) or via
a Hangout that you should schedule.

**Rest of the team**

At any point in time at least half of the support team must be available to handle all our tasks, so
be sure to let everyone know about your plans as soon as you know something. This can be done in the
Availability Calendar. Vacation days are first come first served.

### Illness

You should always take care of yourself and make sure you are healthy. If you need to take a sick day, let
your team members know. If there is an important ticket pending, ask one of your colleagues to help you if
you foresee that you will be unavailable for more than 1 day.

If you are on-call but ill, ask one of your colleagues to cover for you.

### Unforeseen events

If you need to take care of something urgent, there is no need to ask for permission. Just notify the team
via the #marketing channel in Slack. If you are on-call, ask one of your colleagues to
cover for you.
