## Welcome to our General Guidelines page

1. Working at GitLab Inc. is cooperating with the most talented people you've ever worked with, being the **most productive** you'll ever be, and creating software that is helping the most people you've ever reached.
1. We recognize that inspiration is perishable, so if youâ€™re **enthusiastic** about something that generates great results in relatively little time feel free to work on that.
1. Do what is right for our **customers** and the rest of the GitLab community, do what is best over the long term, don't be evil.
1. We create **simple** software to accomplish complex collaborative tasks.
1. We **use** our own software to accomplish complex collaborative tasks.
1. Do **not** make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin color, gender, or sexual orientation.
1. Use **inclusive** language. For example, prefer "Hi everybody" or "Hi people" to "Hi guys".
1. Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and **speak up**.
1. Don't display surprise when people say they don't know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand." (As inspired by [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).)
1. All our procedures and templates are stored in (mostly public) git repositories instead of Google/Word documents. This makes them easier to find and suggest changes to with the organization and shows our commitment to open collaboration outside the organization.
1. Work out in the **open**, try to use public issue trackers and repositories when possible.
1. Most things are **public** unless there is a reason not to. Not public by default are:
   - financial and legal information
   - individual job applications / compensation / feedback
   - partnerships with other companies
   - customer information in issues: if an issue needs to contain _any_ specific information about a customer, including but not limited to company name, employee names, number of users, the issue should be made confidential.
1. Share solutions you find and answers you receive with the **whole community**.
1. If you make a mistake, don't worry, correct it and **proactively** let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it and how, if needed, you changed the process to prevent future mistakes.
1. You can always **refuse** to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.
1. Everyone can **remind** anyone in the company about these guidelines. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.
1. If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer) please let your boss, or the CEO, know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are **small**.
1. We want to have a great company so if you meet people that are **better** than yourself try to recruit them to join the company.
1. Make a conscious effort to **recognize** the constraints of others within the team. For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and Development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.
1. Please read and contribute to our [**strategy**](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/).
1. For each action or comment, it helps to ask yourself (i) does this help the company achieve its strategic goals? (ii) is this in the company's interest, and finally, (iii) how can I contribute to this effort/issue in a constructive way?
1. There is no need for **consensus**, make sure that you give people that might have good insights a chance to respond (by /cc'ing them) but make a call yourself because [consensus doesn't scale](https://twitter.com/sama/status/585950222703992833).
1. Everyone at the company cares about your **output**. Being away from the keyboard during the workday, doing private browsing or making personal phone calls is fine and encouraged.
1. If you fix something for GitLab.com or one of our users, make sure to make that the default (preferred) and **radiate** the information in the docs. We should run GitLab.com with the same default settings and setup our users would also have, if we deviate from it we should add it to the [settings page for GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/settings/).
1. Everything is **always in draft** and subject to change, including this handbook. So do not delay documenting things and do not include "draft" in the titles of documents. Ensure everyone can read the current state. Nothing will ever be finished.
1. Explicitly note what **next action** you propose or expect and from whom.
1. Before **replying** to a request, complete the requested task first. Otherwise, indicate when you plan to complete it in your response. In the latter case, always send a message after the task is subsequently completed.
1. Respect the **privacy** of our users and your fellow GitLabbers. Secure our production data at all times. Only work with production data when this is needed to perform your job. Looking into production data for malicious reasons (for example, [LOVEINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOVEINT) or spying on direct messages of GitLabbers) is a fireable offense.
1. Most guidelines in this handbook are meant to help, and unless stated otherwise, are meant to help more than being absolute rules. Don't be afraid to do something because you can't oversee all guidelines. Be gentle when reminding people about these guidelines, saying for example, "It is not a problem, but next time please consider the following guideline from the handbook.".
1. Also see our [leadership guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/#guidelines).

## On-Call Rotation and Scheduling

We have on-call heroes (see the [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/)) to
respond quickly to GitLab.com downtime, and customer emergencies. Details about the schedule
and how to swap duty in the [On-Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/on-call/) page.

## Intellectual Property

1. Take proper care of any **confidential** information you get from our customers.
1. If you copy code always **check** the license and attribute when needed or appropriate.
1. Check community **contributions** and do not merge it when there can be doubt about the ownership.
1. Only the CEO of the company **signs** legal documents such as NDAs. Sales people and the business office manager can upload them via HelloSign.
1. View our [DMCA policy](https://about.gitlab.com/dmca) in regards to copyright /
intellectual property violations
1. Comply with the [GitLab Inc. Proprietary Information and Assignment Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-55l7O7L2BOMzFBsHLKheJW4v_1HfU-SiAKxSOlk9cQ/edit) and/or [GitLab B.V. NDA and IP Agreements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aWeNkw0J5O-BOBZXi8U0LUDEnjcvuWWiQXHVy-f_Pz0/edit#).
