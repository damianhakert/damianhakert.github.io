Every salesperson who starts at GitLab will enter an intense 30-day sales bootcamp.  The weekly class schedule can be found at [GitLab University](https://about.gitlab.com/university/).  In addition, once a new salesperson starts, their manager will create an issue for each of the first 4 weeks, tracking the progress of the new hire.
