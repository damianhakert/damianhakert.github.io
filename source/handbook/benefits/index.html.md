NOTE: Our contractor agreements and employment contracts are all on the [Contracts](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) page.


## Regular compensation <a name="regular-compensation"></a>

1. Employees of our Dutch entity (GitLab B.V.) will get their salary wired on the
25th of every month, and can see their pay slip in their personal portal on
[HR Savvy's system](https://hr-savvy.nmbrs.nl/) towards the end of the month.
1. Employees of our US entity (GitLab Inc.) have payroll processed semi-monthly
through TriNet, and they can access their pay slips through the [TriNet portal](https://www.hrpassport.com).
1. Contractors to GitLab (either entity) should send their invoices for services rendered to ap@gitlab.com
   - For 'fixed fee' contracts, it is OK to send the invoice before the time period
   that it covers is over. For example, an invoice covering the period of March 1-31 can be sent on March 25.
   - All invoices are internally reviewed, approved, and then payment is processed.
   This is usually a fast process, but be aware that it can incur delays around vacations.
   - An invoice template can be found as a Google sheet named "Invoice Template" (also listed on the [finance page](/handbook/finance/) )
1. To process any changes, see the directions on the [people-operations page](/handbook/people-operations/sop/#processing-changes).

## General Benefits <a name="general-benefits"></a>

1. GitLab will pay for the items listed under [spending company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#spending-company-money).
1.  Deceased team member
    In the unfortunate event that a GitLab team member passes away, GitLab will
    provide a $20,000 lump sum to anyone of their choosing. This can be a spouse,
    partner, family member, friend, or charity.
      * For US based employees of GitLab Inc., this benefit is replaced by the
        [Basic Life Insurance](#basic-life-ins) that is offered through TriNet.
      * For all other team members, the following conditions apply:
         * The team member must be either an employee or direct contractor,
         * The team member must have indicated in writing to whom the money
           should be transferred.
         * For part-time team members, the lump sum is calculated pro-rata, so
           for example for a team member that works for GitLab 50% of the time,
           the lump sum would be $10,000.

#### Short and Long-Term Disability Insurance<a name="std-ltd"></a>

Disability insurance plans are designed to provide income protection while you recover

facilitate your return to work. TriNet offers several short and long term disability
plan options. Note: There are five states that have state-mandated disability insurance requirements
California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. If you do not live in one of the listed
states it is recommended that you elect Short Term Disability Insurance through TriNet to protect
your financial situation. For more information on State Disability Insurance please contact People Ops.
