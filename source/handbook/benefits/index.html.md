## General Benefits

1. GitLab will pay for the items listed under [spending company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#spending-company-money).
1. [Stock options](/handbook/stock-options/) are offered to most team members.
1.  Deceased team member:
    In the unfortunate event that a GitLab team member passes away, GitLab will
    provide a $20,000 lump sum to anyone of their choosing. This can be a spouse,
    partner, family member, friend, or charity.
      * For US based employees of GitLab Inc., this benefit is replaced by the
        [Basic Life Insurance](#basic-life-ins) that is offered through TriNet.
      * For all other team members, the following conditions apply:
         * The team member must be either an employee or direct contractor,
         * The team member must have indicated in writing to whom the money
           should be transferred.
         * For part-time team members, the lump sum is calculated pro-rata, so
           for example for a team member that works for GitLab 50% of the time,
           the lump sum would be $10,000.
1. [Paid time off policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#paid-time-off).
1. GitLab Summit
   * Every six to nine months team members gather at an exciting new location to [stay connected](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/12/05/how-we-stay-connected-as-a-remote-company/), at what we like to call a GitLab Summit. It is important to spend time face to face to get to know your team and, if possible, meet everyone who has also [bought into the company vision](http://www.excitingrole.com/how-to-do-startup-due-diligence/#.h/). There are fun activities planned by our GitLab Summit Experts, work time, and presentations from different functional groups to make this an experience that you are unlikely to forget! Attendance is optional, but encouraged. For more information about the past summits check out our [culture page](https://about.gitlab.com/culture/).

Disability insurance plans are designed to provide income protection while you recover
from a disability. This coverage not only ensures that you are able to receive some
income while out on disability; it also provides absence management support that helps
facilitate your return to work. TriNet offers several short and long term disability
plan options. Note: There are five states that have state-mandated disability insurance requirements
California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. If you do not live in one of the listed
states it is recommended that you elect Short Term Disability Insurance through TriNet to protect
your financial situation. For more information on State Disability Insurance please contact People Ops.
