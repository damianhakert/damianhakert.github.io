## Paid Time Off
Time away from work can be extremely healthy to maintain a work/life balance. GitLab encourages managers and leadership to set the example of taking time off when you need it, and ensuring their reports do the same.

For example, our CEO, went on a wonderful vacation to Hawaii with his significant other for a week.  

A service engineer remarked that “In the 3 months I've been at GitLab, I've taken more time off than the last 2 years at my previous job.”

Another great example of taking time off is a GitLabber taking the day to do some spring cleaning, because vacations are not always to exotic places, but instead might be taking some time for themselves, at home or abroad.

It is so important to take time off to recharge batteries and refresh the mind so you can come back to GitLab with new energy and be prepared to do your best work ever!

## A GitLabber's Guide to Time Off

As we all work remotely it can sometimes be difficult to know when and how to plan time off. Please find some advice and guidance below on how this can be done in a collaborative and easy way.

1. We have an "unlimited" time off policy. This means that:
    * You do not need to ask permission to take time off unless you want to take more than 25 consecutive calendar days.
    * Always make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away.
    * We strongly recommended to take at least a minimum of 2 weeks of vacation per year, if you take less your manager might follow up to discuss your work load.
1. We don't frown on people taking time off, but rather encourage that people take care of themselves and others by having some time away. Especially if you notice that your co-worker is working long hours over a sustained period.
1. Working hours are flexible, you are invited to the [team call](#team-call) if you are available, and if you want you can post to the #working-on chat channel what is on your mind so others can offer suggestions.
1. You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, [take a nap](https://m.signalvnoise.com/sleep-deprivation-is-not-a-badge-of-honor-f24fbff47a75), go grocery shopping, doing household chores, helping someone, taking care of a loved one, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected and you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team **knows** and someone can pick up any urgent tasks.
1. GitLab encourages team members to volunteer within their community to take care of others.
1. Add an **appointment** to the GitLab availability calendar well in advance of your plans (if possible), you can always change it later. Invite your manager to the calendar event so that they know you will be away.
1. In case it can be useful add your planned time off as a **FYI** on the next agenda of the team call.
1. You do need to ensure that not more than **half** of the people that can help with availability emergencies (the on-call heroes), regular support, sales, or development are gone at any moment. You can check for this on the availability calendar, so be sure to add appointments early.
1. Being part of a global remote team means you need to be highly organized and a considerate team player. Each team has busy times so it is always a good idea to check with them to ensure there is adequate coverage in place.
1. Please see the [On-Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/on-call/)
page for information on how to handle scheduled leave for someone from the [on-call](#on-call) team.
1. We will **help** clients during official days off, unless they are official days off in both the Netherlands and the U.S. We try to have people working who are in a country that don't have an official day off. If you need to work during an official day off in your country, you should take a day off in return.
1. Please also remember to turn on your out of office message and include contact details of a co-worker in case anything urgent or critical comes into your inbox while you're away. If you have to respond to an incident while being on-call outside of your regular working hours, you should feel free to take off some time the following day to recover and be well-rested. If you feel pressure to _not_ take the time off to rest, refer to this part of the handbook and explain that you had to handle an incident.

### Management’s Role in Paid Time Off

Managers have a duty of care towards their direct reports in managing their wellbeing and ensuring that time off is being taken. When working from home remotely, at times the work life balance can be difficult to find. It is also easy to forget that your team is working across multiple timezones, some may feel obligated to work longer to ensure there is overlap. It is important that you check-in with your reports at your one-to-ones and if you think someone needs some time off let them know they can do this.

If you discover that multiple people in your team want to be off at the same time, use good judgement, see what the priorities are and review the impact to the business. Discuss this with your team so you can manage the time off together. It is also a good idea to remind your team to give you and the rest of the team an early heads-up, if possible, about upcoming vacation plans.

### Recognizing Burnout

Encourage your co-workers to take time out when you become aware that they are working long hours over a sustained period. If you feel as though yourself or someone on your team is experiencing [burnout](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642), be sure to address it. For example, you can communicate to your manager "I'm feeling like I might burn out if the situation doesn't change."
