### TRIAL GUIDELINES

GitLab wants your company to have a successful Trial with GitLab Enterprise Edition. 

This Success Document creates a framework which will guarantee a successful 

trial for your company. It defines your company's current state and desired state.

It also identifies your current challenges and the accompanying business problems

that these challenges generate. Lastly, we identify the specific Success Criteria for your

Trial as well GitLab's and your company's commitment and the timeframe of the Trial.
