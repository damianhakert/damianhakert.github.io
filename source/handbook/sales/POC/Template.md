The purpose of this document is to outline the GitLab Trial being performed with

XYZ, Inc. It defines the scope, technical guidelines, sequence of events, and

the success criteria for both XYZ, Inc. and GitLab to reference while planning

and executing the Trial. Since this project requires the use of resources from

both of our companies, we request that you approve this document prior to

beginning the Trial.  This will assure that both companies understand and agree

on expectations, time frame, and the criteria that will be used to gauge the

success of the Trial. 

# CURRENT STATE

•	XYZ, Inc. currently uses the products of multiple vendors for Version

Control and Collaboration – there is no companywide standard.
•	As a contractor of the United States Government, XYZ, Inc. needs to comply

with strict Federal security requirements – FedRamp FISMA certification
•	XYZ, Inc. has between 500 – 600 Teams who use the current systems

# CHALLENGES

•	Since multiple vendors are used, XYZ, Inc. has issues with manageability,

control, visibility and reporting of the different systems being used.

•	Challenge 2

•	Challenge 3

# DESIRED STATE

•	Standardize companywide on a Git-based Version Control System

•	Improved Control, Visibility, Manageability and Reporting

•	Have the chosen solution hosted in the Amazon GovCloud

•	FedRamp FISMA Compliance

•	Better User and Group Management


# BUSINESS PROBLEM

XYZ, Inc. is looking to standardize on one Git-based solution which will be used

companywide. Currently there are number of different solutions in place and this

makes managing, controlling and reporting on the disparate systems difficult.
