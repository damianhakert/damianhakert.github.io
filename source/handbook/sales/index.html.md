### GitLab Version Check <a name="version_check"></a>

Before prospecting and engaging with a prospect, check to see if they are using CE. To do this, use GitLab Version Check. Everything about [GitLab Version Check](/handbook/sales-process/version_check).

### Parent and Child Accounts <a name="parent"></a>

* A Parent account is the business/organization which owns another business/organization.  Example: Disney is the parent account of ESPN and ABC.
* A Child Account is the organization you may have an opportunity with but is owned by the Parent Account.
* You may have a opportuity with the Parent account and a Child Account.  Example: Disney and ESPN may both be customers and have opportunities.
* When selling into a new division (which has their own budget, different mailing address, and decision process) create a new account.  This is the Child Account.  For every child account, you must select the parent account by using the parent account field on the account page.
* We want to do this as we can keep each opportunity with each child account separate and easily find all accounts and opportunities tied to a parent account.

### When to create an Opportunity <a name="opportunity"></a>

Before a lead is converted or an opportunity is created the following must occur:

* Identified problem GitLab can solve - happens during introductory call
* Interest by prospect to learn more about GitLab - moving to discovery stage
* Discovery call scheduled with prospect - moving to discovery stage
* Interest by GitLab salesperson to pursue the opportunity
* If you have given a quote (pricing) please convert as this is now a sales opportunity

### Opportunity Naming Convention <a name="naming"></a>

Opportunities will follow the following rules:

* Subscription: [name of company] [type of subscription] [number of packs]. Example: MicahTek, Inc.-Standard-1
* Training: [name of company] [type of training: User Training/Git Workshop/GitLab Flow/GitLab Admin].
Example: First Community Credit Union User-Training. **Note** to set up the actual training,
follow the workflow described on the [Support handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/).

Once the above has happened, please make sure the following actions are done:

1. Attach any signed agreement, PO, and/or quote as an attachment to the account page/object in Salesforce.com
1. Add in the competition we were up against in the opportunity.  This can be the legacy SCM solution they had and/or who they were evaluating along side of us. This can also be ourselves, meanign GitLab CE or .com
1. Create an add-on or Existing Account (new division) opportunity if there has been one identified by you at this time.
1. An automated task is created to check in with the Account, 30 days after the deal closes.  The purpose for this check in is to make sure they are happy, address any questions they have, ask them to be a reference or to speak with our product marketing team on how they use GitLab.
  * If the customer agrees to be a reference, please check the box on the account object called "referenceable customer".  Also go to the contact object who agreed to be a reference and under the field "role" please select "reference - investors and prospects"
  * If customer agrees to speak with product marketing about how they use GitLab, please email product marketing manager
1. Once the opportunity is closed won, the field "type" on the account object will change to "customer"
1. A task will be auto created in Salesforce.com reminding you to update the Technology Stack field on the account to reflect the GitLab Tools they are using. Example: GitLab Issue Tracker, CI, Wiki

#### View and download invoices in Salesforce:

As soon as an invoice was generated, the sales rep can view and download it as a PDF in Salesforce. Scroll to the bottom within the Salesforce-Account and click on the invoice number under "Invoices". Then on the bottom of the invoice view, click "Invoice PDF".

### Using Cases in Salesforce <a name="cases"></a>

A case is a question or feedback from a prospect or customer. Each of us can review cases to see how we can deliver better service.

When a case is submitted, if the contacts email address is in salesforce, the contact owner will be assigned to the case.  If there is no match, the case will go to our [BDR Queue](https://na34.salesforce.com/500?fcf=00B610000042ioq). Anyone can check this queue and reassign to yourself if this is your contact or respond to this case.

Cases display in an Emails related list. The Emails related list includes all emails sent by your customer regarding a particular case, as well the email threads between you and your customer. The first 77 characters of an email message appear in the related list so that you can see what the message is about without having to click on it.

#### To work with Email-to-Case or On-Demand Email-to-Case emails:
* Click Send An Email to send an email to a contact, another user, or any other email address. Select a "From Address".  Preferrably use sales@ address.
* Click Reply to respond to an email. The email response automatically includes the email body as received from the customer. Enter your response and click Send.
* Click To All to respond to all participants on an email thread.
* The email address of the contact who created the case automatically appears in the To field, as long as the creator is an existing contact. To add more recipients, click Lookup icon to look up an address, or type or paste email addresses or names in the To field.
* When you enter an email address or name that matches one contact or user, the address appears as a button with the person’s name.
* To add several addresses at once, copy and paste them separated by spaces or commas. These email addresses appear as buttons, and, if they’re associated with a contact or user, show the contact’s name.
* When you enter an email address that matches multiple contacts or users, the address appears as a button. Clicking the button brings up a list of people associated with the email address so you can choose the one you want to associate with the message.
* If you need to copy other people on the message, click Add Cc or Add Bcc.
* By default, the email subject is the name of the case it’s related to. You can edit the subject if you need to.

* Click the subject of the email to view the email. From the email, you can reply to the sender, reply to everyone, forward the email, or delete it.
* While viewing an email, you can display a list of all the emails associated with the case by clicking Email Message List, and you can navigate to the case's other emails by clicking Next or Previous.
* While viewing an email, click Forward to forward it. The email automatically includes the email body as received from the customer. Optionally, enter text and click Send.

#### Closing a Case
* Before closing a case, make sure that the account is associated with the case
* Choose the case reason before you close

### Process after you close a Premium Support Subscription <a name="premium-support"></a>

Once you close a Premium Support Subscription deal, you need to do a few things.

1. When possible, create an issue on dev.gitlab.org under Organization with the Support label as soon as it is clear that a dedicated service engineer will be needed. Service Engineers can volunteer, or they will be assigned by VP Engineering if nobody is volunteering. It can depend on the client, and factors like: timezone, language, specific needs, etc.
Once this is determined, please add the Dedicated Service Engineer to the Salesforce account with the drop down.
1. The next step is to introduce your client to their Dedicated Engineer, and if necessary, work together to schedule an on-boarding call to cover any questions, and give an overview of the support they are entitled to.
1. You would have probably brought this up prior to the deal closing, but if the client is interested in joining the Slack support channel, please work with the Dedicated Engineer to make this happen.

#### Contributing to EE Direction <a name="EE-Direction"></a>
Being in a customer facing role, salespeople are expected to contribute to [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/).  Each day we talk to customers and prospects we have the opportunity to hear of a feature they find valuable or to give feedback (positive and constructive) to an EE feature that there is an issue for.
When you hear of feedback or you personally have feedback, we encourage you to comment within the issue, if one exists, or create your own issue on our [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues). Checking the [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) page and the [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues) should happen throughout the week.

### Export Control Classification, and Countries We Do Not Do Business In <a name="export-control"></a>

GitLab's Export Control Classification (or ECCN) is 5D002.c.1
with CCATS number G163509.
This means that GitLab source code can be exported and re-exported under the
authority of license exception TSU of section [740.13(e)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the export administration regulations (EAR).

Per [740.13(e)(2)(ii)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the EAR, there are restrictions on "Any knowing export or reexport
to a country listed in [Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_download/944-740-supp-1)".

As a consequence of this classification, we currently do not do business in:
Iran, Sudan (excluding South Sudan), Syria, North Korea, and Cuba.
