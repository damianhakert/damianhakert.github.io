### Sales Team Call

1. The Sales team call is every Monday and Wednesday from 9:00am to 9:30am Pacific Time.
1. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for the call since Hangouts is capped at 15 people, link is in the calendar invite, and also listed at the top of the Sales Team Agenda.
1. The call is recorded automatically, and all calls are transferred every hour to a Google Drive folder called "GitLab Videos". There is a subfolder called "Sales Team Meeting", which is accessible to all users with a GitLab.com e-mail account.
1. We start on time and will not wait for people.
1. Person who has first item on the agenda starts the call.
1. If you are unable to attend just add your name to the [Sales Team Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l1ecVjKAJY67Zk28CYFiepHAFzvMNu9yDUYVSQmlTmU/edit) as 'Not attending'.
1. We start by discussing the subjects that are on the agenda for today.
   * Everyone is free to add subjects. Please start with your name and be sure to link to an issue, merge request or commit if that is relevant.
   * When done with a point mention the subject of the next item and hand over to the next person.
   * When someone passes the call to you, no need to say, “Can you hear me?” Just begin talking. If we can’t hear you, we’ll let you know.
1. Even if you cannot join the call, consider reviewing the recorded call or at minimum read through the sales team agenda and the links from there.

### Market segmentation
Sales segments the market based on IT or [TEDD](https://discoverorg.com/discoverorg-sales-intelligence-platform/data-sets-for-marketing-sales-and-staffing/technology-engineering-design-and-development-tedd-dataset/) employees
1. Strategic: 5000+ employees
2. Large: 750 - 4999 employees
3. Mid Market: 100 - 749 employees
4. SMB: less than 100 employees

We have two sales positions focused on selling into these markets.
1. Sr. Account Executive for Strategic and Large Accounts
2. Account Executive for Mid Market Accounts
3. SMB is our transactional business, managed by the Business Development Team and processed through our web portal.

### GitLab Version Check

Before prospecting and engaging with a prospect, check to see if they are using CE. To do this, use GitLab Version Check. Everything about [GitLab Version Check](/handbook/sales-process/version_check).

### Parent and Child Accounts

* A Parent Account is the business/organization which owns another business/organization.  Example: The Walt Disney Company is the parent account of Disney-ABC Television Group and Disney.com.
* A Child Account is the organization you may have an opportunity with but is owned by the Parent Account. A Child Account can be a business unit, subsidiary, or a satellite office of the Parent Account.
* You may have a opportunity with the Parent account and a Child Account.  Example: Disney and ESPN may both be customers and have opportunities. However, the very first deal with a Parent Account, whether it is with the Parent Account or Child Account, should be marked as "New Business". All other deals under the Parent Account will fall under Add-On Business, Existing Account - Cross-Sell, or Renewal Business (see Opportunity Types section).
* If the Parent and Child accounts have the same company name, either add the division, department, business unit, or location to the end of the account name. For example, Disney would be the name of the Parent Account, but the Child Account would be called The Walt Disney Company Latin America or The Walt Disney Company, Ltd Japan.
* When selling into a new division (which has their own budget, different mailing address, and decision process) create a new account.  This is the Child Account.  For every child account, you must select the parent account by using the parent account field on the account page. If done properly, the Parent/Child relationship will be displayed in the Account Hierarchy section of the account page.
* Remember that a child account can also be a parent account for another account. For example, Disney-ABC Television Group is the child for The Walt Disney Company, but is the parent for ABC Entertainment Group.
* We want to do this as we can keep each opportunity with each child account separate and easily find all accounts and opportunities tied to a parent account, as well as roll-up all Closed Won business against a Parent Account.

### When to create an Opportunity

Before a lead is converted or an opportunity is created the following must occur:

* Identified problem GitLab can solve - happens during introductory call
* Interest by prospect to learn more about GitLab - moving to discovery stage
* Discovery call scheduled with prospect - moving to discovery stage
* Interest by GitLab salesperson to pursue the opportunity
* If you have given a quote (pricing) please convert as this is now a sales opportunity

### Reseller Opportunities

Opportunities utilizing a reseller require slightly different data:

* Opportunity Name:  
If the partner is an authorized reseller, rename the opportunity with the partner’s nick-name in front, then a dash.  For instance; if it is a Perforce deal, the opportunity name should start with P4 - (whatever your opportunity name is)  This is important for the workflow that solicits updates from the reseller.  

* Account Name:  
It is important that opportunities using a reseller are created on the END CUSTOMER’s account, and not the reseller’s account.  The account name on an opportunity is never a reseller.  Resellers do not buy licenses; they purchase them on the behalf of an end customer.  For instance, the account name field on an opportunity should never be SHI.

* Opportunity Owner:  
Should be the name of the AE who is working the deal with the reseller

* Associating Contact Roles:  
After creating the opportunity, click “New” in the contact section to associate contacts with the opportunity.
 - The primary contact should always be a contact at the end user’s account and not a contact at the reseller.  This is important as resellers come and go, and if we do not capture the contact at the end user account, we will not be able to sell to this account if the reseller ends their relationship with us or with the end account.
 - A reseller contact (say, the sales rep at ReleaseTEAM) can, and should be added to the opportunity with the role of Influencer.  NOTE: A contact that works for a reseller should never be added to an end user account.  For instance an employee of SoftwareOne should be a contact of the SoftwareOne account only, and not the Boeing account.  

* Associating Partners to an Opportunity:  
After creating the opportunity, click “New” in the Partners section to associate the reseller with the opportunity.
 - You can associate multiple partners with an opportunity if there is more than one reseller involved in the opportunity.  This is not uncommon for government opportunities, or opportunities where the customer is asking multiple fulfillment houses (like SHI and SoftwareOne) to fulfill the order.

Gitorious Opportunities:

### Opportunity Types

1. New Business - This type should be used for any new account (business) who signs up either through the sales team or via the web portal. Paid training also falls under this type if the organization does not have an enterprise license.
1. Add-on Business- This type should be used for any incremental/upsell business sold into an existing account and division mid term, meaning not at renewal.
1. Existing Account - Cross-Sell- This type should be used for new business sold into an existing account but a new division, a new purchasing group.
1. Renewal - This type should be used for an existing account renewing their license with GitLab.  Renewals can have their value increased, decreased, or stay the same.  We capture growth/loss as a field in Salesforce.com

### Opportunity Stages

1. Discovery - research, fact finding, identify contacts, current situation,
1. Developing - isolate the opportunities, assess needs, qualify the opportunities, build rapport, access decision makers, understand decision process and criteria, Collaborate on solutions, define the business case, assess competition

1. Negotiating - negotiate business terms resolve objections, set close plan (sequence of events), gain commitment
1. Verbal Commitment - how a company approves s business teams desire to purchase, how the company vets purchases from a legal, info security, risk, compliance, and vendor management perspective
1. Won - Deal won and booked
1. Lost - Opportunity not won at this time
1. Unqualified - This should only be used when an opportunity is passed from the BDR team, but does not meet our standard qualification criteria. Once you've moved the opportunity to Discovery or later, the opportunity can no longer be marked as Unqualified.

### Escalation to Support

Customers that require technical assistance or have questions that are not within the scope of sales can have their queries escalated to the GitLab support team via the following channels.

1. Create a new ticket on behalf of the customer in the [support web form](https://support.gitlab.com)
1. For quick questions, see the [internal support](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/support/#internal-support-for-gitlab-team-members) section of the support handbook.
1. Forward a customer question via email to the **support** email address. - It's important the email is **forwarded** and not CC'd to avoid additional changes required once the support request is lodged.

### Contributing to EE Direction

Being in a customer facing role, salespeople are expected to contribute to [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/).  Each day we talk to customers and prospects we have the opportunity to hear of a feature they find valuable or to give feedback (positive and constructive) to an EE feature that there is an issue for.
When you hear of feedback or you personally have feedback, we encourage you to comment within the issue, if one exists, or create your own issue on our [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues). Checking the [GitLab Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) page and the [EE Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues) should happen throughout the week.

### Export Control Classification, and Countries We Do Not Do Business In

GitLab's Export Control Classification (or ECCN) is 5D002.c.1 with CCATS number G163509.
This means that GitLab source code can be exported and re-exported under the authority of license exception TSU of section [740.13(e)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the export administration regulations (EAR).

Per [740.13(e)(2)(ii)](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_view/986-740) of the EAR, there are restrictions on "Any knowing export or reexport
to a country listed in [Country Group E:1 in Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/doc_download/944-740-supp-1)".

As a consequence of this classification, we currently do not do business in Iran, Sudan (excluding South Sudan), Syria, North Korea, and Cuba.
