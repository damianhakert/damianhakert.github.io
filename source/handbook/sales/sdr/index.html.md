## Job Description

As a Sales Development Representative (SDR) you are focused on driving net new business for the company. We thrive on competition and our ability to cold call/email. You will be aligned with Account Executives (AE’s) to work a strategic list of 50-100 targeted accounts on a quarterly basis..

## Expectations

You will be expected to:

* Have a good balance of phone calls made and emails sent (there are no daily metric requirements around this)
* Complete the GitLab beginner, intermediate, and expert certification courses
* Be able to demo GitLab to one of the sales directors

## Working with AE’s

A good portions  of your job requires you to work with assigned AE’s. This is key to our role as SDRs’ because they will not only help you create an appropriate strategy to go after specific accounts, but they will help you build your career as a future AE for GitLab. It is crucial that you build a relationship of honesty and trust. 

### Account Distribution

* When you are assigned to your AE’s you will work with them to create a list of accounts for you to go after. This should consist of ~50-100 accounts to work in a given quarter. 
* In the situation that you do not have assigned AE’s, your Team Lead will provide you with a list of unnamed top strategic accounts to go after. (When you create meetings you will need to coordinate with your Team Lead to decide what AE that account will go to. You will also work with your Team Lead to develop strategy for your assigned accounts).
* In the event that you feel your accounts are non-workable please consult with your Team Lead.

### Account Management

* We use SalesForce as our CRM to manage accounts. 
* When it comes to task management there are a couple of different ways to do so. You can use either SFDC (SalesForce.com) or you can use Outreach which is primarily used for emailing. 

### SDR/AE Relationship

* Communication is priority in our company. You will need to create a working relationship with your assigned AE’s. 
* The relationship between you and your AE’s should be one of trust, honesty, and openness. It is important to understand that this relationship is a two-way street. The SDR and the AE will need to put in equal amounts of effort to make this relationship work. When the relationship works, both the SDR and AE become successful. 
* There should be, at minimum, a weekly 1:1 with each your AE’s to discuss:
* Where you are at for the month, metric wise.
* What you have done with the accounts you are working. (This will be what is working well, what you have found out about company structure, who are the right people to talk to, and meetings/opportunities you have created.)
* Discuss evolving strategy for “currently working” accounts and “new accounts” you will be going after.
