## On-boarding process for Premium Support

After purchase of a Premium Support subscription is completed, the following steps will take place:

- Sales verifies that the all the necessary contact information exists in the SalesForce record for the customer
   - Email address of the primary contact person is mandatory
   - Domain name where email requests will come from is required for proper Zendesk routing
- Sales sends the customer an email message with the [text contained here](premium_support_message.txt) so the customer knows what to expect.
- Sales opens a [confidential issue in the support project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/issues)
   - Apply the ["Premium support onboarding"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Premium%20support%20onboarding.md) issue template, and follow the steps outlined in the template.
   - Assign the issue to the "Support Lead"
