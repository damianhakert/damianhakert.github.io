title: "Account Expansion Plan Template"
---

For each account we have identifed there is significant growth opportunity, we want to create an account expansion plan to help us realize the potential for every account.
To create an account expansion plan:

1. Create a new issue withing the [Customer Success Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/issues).  This is a private project so customer names can be mentioned.
1. Name the issue "Account Name - Expansion Plan"
1. Copy and paste the template below into the issue you just created
1. Modify the template based on your specific situation with any tasks you feel would be relevant.  This template is just a guide.
1. For any tasks you are needing help on, please add a comment noting the actual task and cc the person you are requesting help from and the ask you have of them.

- [ ] Do you need to send any trial license keys to other groups, or trial's for GitLab Products? Use [POC template](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/POC/)
- [ ] If so, did you set a meeting 2 weeks into it to hear about their experience so far? 
- [ ] Have you found out what potential deal blockers are, and if there are reasons they wouldn't expand, what would those be? 
- [ ] Plan to resolve concerns shared with prospect?
- [ ] After your meeting with the DM/DM's, what is your next step after sending them a follow up? 
- [ ] Next meeting date confirmed ?
