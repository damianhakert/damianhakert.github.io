title: "Account Expansion Plan Template"
---

For each account we have identifed there is significant growth opportunity, we want to create an account expansion plan to help us realize the potential for every account.
The list of accounts we are targetting for expansion, can be found [here](https://na34.salesforce.com/00O61000003SenE).  To be on this list, the field large accounts, must be checked off and type must equal customer.  To determine the potential EE subscription amount, the total # of potential users needs to be added.
To create an account expansion plan:

1. Create a new issue withing the [Customer Success Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/issues).  This is a private project so customer names can be mentioned.
1. Name the issue "Account Name - Expansion Plan"
1. Copy and paste the template below into the issue you just created
1. Modify the template based on your specific situation with any tasks you feel would be relevant.  This template is just a guide.
1. For any tasks you are needing help on, please add a comment noting the actual task and cc the person you are requesting help from and the ask you have of them.
