## Elevator pitches

Whatever role you have at GitLab there will be a time when you will be asked what you do? 

What do you tell your frineds and family you do for a living? 

The definition of a elevator pitch is a short summary of what we do and is designed to get the conversation going, it is not designed to be a sales pitch or a deep dive into the toolset. 
One of the most important things to remember is the importance of knowing the audience you are speaking to. Are you are speaking to Aunt Agnes or the lead developer at Tesla Motors, the same response for both would have totally different conversations.
They are designed as a primer, to get the conversation started. To give the person you are speaking with just enough information for them to understand what we do and hopefully get them to want to know more or not! At least they will know what you do to day to day.

### Know your audience , know the objective

You are not giving a Sales pitch, you are not selling our platform just staring the conversation. Who knows where the conversation will lead and there will be different objectives for different scenarios. 
Hopefully you will have some very interesting conversations on the back of these opening gambits and meet some interesting people and also grow your personal network.

### When will you use our elevator pitches?

You'll be surprised how many times you will use them not just in "work" occasions but also in "non work" occasions. 
Below you will find some example of pitches that we have put together please feel free to add ones that you use or make suggestions on ways to improve

What is the difference between you and GitHub/BitBucket?


What version are you using? GitLab.com EE same for BitBucket.


##### 1: We are a complete, open source suite of integrated tools and/or 3rd party integrations for every aspect of the modern software development lifecycle, with a hosted and on-premise solution. Our competitors don’t do this! 
Details: Geo, CI, Docker Registry, Cycle Analytics, Review Apps, Built-in Chat and ChatOps


GitHub has an on-premise EE solution.
BitBucket has an on-premise and managed EE solution.


##### 2: For EE we have CI built in so you don’t have to pay for something like Jenkins, we are open source.


##### 3: In contrast to our competitors, GitLab integrates all tools for the modern software development lifecycle into one single product, while also providing 3rd-party integrations due to our Open Source and Open Development approach. You can also use GitLab on-premise and as a SaaS solution. Both options are available for free and as professional service.


###### 4: We are 100% open source and transparent – an advantage for companies which require a high level of security (such as banks). 


###### 5: We are open source, ship updates on the 22nd of each month and will soon be offering time-tracking. Our tool contains everything you need to get from idea to production on a single platform, although you’re not tied to that – if you wanted to integrate with Jira/Jenkins, for example, GitLab supports integration.
