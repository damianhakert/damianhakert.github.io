Pitches:


Opening statement:


What do you do? 
What do you currently use for your version control? Do you use Git?
Where do you currently store your source code?


What is the difference between you and GitHub/BitBucket?


What version are you using? GitLab.com EE same for BitBucket.


Pitch 1: We are a complete, open source suite of integrated tools and/or 3rd party integrations for every aspect of the modern software development lifecycle, with a hosted and on-premise solution. Our competitors don’t do this! 
Details: Geo, CI, Docker Registry, Cycle Analytics, Review Apps, Built-in Chat and ChatOps


GitHub has an on-premise EE solution.
BitBucket has an on-premise and managed EE solution.


Pitch 2: For EE we have CI built in so you don’t have to pay for something like Jenkins, we are open source.


Pitch 3: In contrast to our competitors, GitLab integrates all tools for the modern software development lifecycle into one single product, while also providing 3rd-party integrations due to our Open Source and Open Development approach. You can also use GitLab on-premise and as a SaaS solution. Both options are available for free and as professional service.


Pitch 4: We are 100% open source and transparent – an advantage for companies which require a high level of security (such as banks). 


Pitch 5: We are open source, ship updates on the 22nd of each month and will soon be offering time-tracking. Our tool contains everything you need to get from idea to production on a single platform, although you’re not tied to that – if you wanted to integrate with Jira/Jenkins, for example, GitLab supports integration. 




Non-technical person:


Pitch 1: We provide tools for developers to help them work better, more efficiently and to reduce the time it takes for them to improve their products that make. 


Pitch 2: GitLab provides all the necessary tools to create an application from idea to completion while enabling efficiency, collaboration and speed during every single step.


Pitch 3: GitLab is an application used by developers to help them code quickly and efficiently without the need to use external tools. It even includes an analytics tool to track your team’s cycle time to help with project planning and management.


Pitch 4: GitLab is helping companies such as X, Y, Z [ Known and relevant companies to the audience] to build products in a faster and more effective manner by having all the tools they need to manage the full workflow, in one place.


Developer:


Pitch 1: GitLab gives you and your team all the tools necessary to collaborate efficiently on a project, from idea to production, while automating tests and deployments. This enables your team to focus on creating better software and have fast and easy deployments.


Pitch 2: GitLab provides all the tools you need in one platform to code, review and deploy your projects efficiently. We integrate with Mattermost so you can even start a project directly from a chat. We ship new features on the 22nd of each month so you are always up to date.


Pitch 3: Our open source code collaboration software offers a full workflow to create, review, and deploy code. GitLab runs on your own server and includes Git repository management, code review, issue tracking, and a CI and deployment tool.


Manager/Decision-maker:


Pitch 1: GitLab gives your team all the tools they need in a single product to create an application from idea to production while enabling efficiency, collaboration and speed at every stage. 


Pitch 2: GitLab provides a tool which allows your developers to move quickly from idea to production within one platform, without the need for external toolsets. With a simple per-user per-year licence, any new licences added are paid for on your yearly renewal date.


Pitch 3: Developers love GitLab. Working with a tool you love makes you happy. Happy developers are naturally more productive. We can go into details from here if you want, but on the very top level this is how it works.


Pitch 4: GitLab helps customers realize a faster application release cycle and more efficient infrastructure management, with all the necessary tools to accelerate idea to production in one platform. This saves money and time, and allows developers to focus on the important things, instead of remembering all the buttons and commands in different interfaces/tools.
