# What to do with feedback

You have feedback about GitLab to share, follow the steps below to make sure it gets the attention it deserves.

The TL;DR is:

1. Create or update an issue
2. Write your feedback in it
3. Link it to relevant sources
4. Label it
5. Mention people

## 1. Find the right place

All feedback belongs under either GitLab CE or EE.

1. If it’s limited to GitLab EE features, go to the [EE issues].
2. Otherwise, bring it to the [CE issue tracker]
3. In doubt, also bring it to the CE issue tracker

## 2. Avoid duplication

1. Using the keywords in your feedback, search for similar issues.
2. If there already is an issue for this, use that issue
3. If not, create a new issue

## 3. Log feedback

1. Write down what the feedback is that you’ve got. In a new issue, this is in the description, in an existing, in a comment.
2. Emit or anonymize sensitive information like customer names and log data
3. Don’t make the issue confidential unless strictly necessary (it almost never is)

## 4. Link it

1. Link to Zendesk, Salesforce, Twitter, HackerNews and others to be able to identify who the request / feedback comes from
2. Link to related resources (issues, merge requests, other websites)

## 5. Label it

Also do this for existing issues if they are not labeled correctly yet.

1. Label your issue `feature proposal`, `bug` or `regression` if it’s one of these.
2. Label your issue `customer` or `customer+` if it’s feedback from customers or premium (or very large) customers

## 6. Mention people

Mention people that are able to do something with this feedback. This is hard to determine in some cases, so use the rule: one is better than none.

- *For bugs* mention an engineering lead or engineer that knows about this particular part. You can search on the team page for who knows about what.
- *For feature proposals* mention a product manager. Search for product manager on the team page for the responsible for a particular area. There’s only a handful, so this should be easy.
- *For others or unknowns* mention any of the above and they’ll figure it out.
