title: "GitLab EE Product Qualification Questions"
---


We need have a library of questions we need to ask in the buying process to help identify and influence the decision process for EE and EE Products. The purpose of these questions is to help us and more importantly the prospect recognize their problem and for us to present the right solution for them, which would be EE and/or an EE Product.

* Lock project membership to the members of a group
  - Do you currently have projects that only certain members of a group should have access to or you would like them to only have access to, instead of the entire group? (problem question)
