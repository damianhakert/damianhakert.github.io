## Onboarding Processes

- **Select a Buddy**
In the "Buddy Spreadsheet" google sheet, select a buddy for the new team member that is in the same timezone, but a different functional group. Try to pair a technical team member with a non-technical team member and vice versa. Also, add the new team member to the sheet so they can also be a buddy one day!
- **Google Account**
Log on to the Google Admin console. Verify that the email that you have chosen for the new team member is not conflicting with a current account or team member's name. Select Users. Click the + sign to add a new user. Once you have created the handle, send an email to the new team member's personal email. Lastly, add the new team member to the New User's group under the Groups tab.
- **Add team member to availability calendar**
Make a new "all-day" event on the day the new team member starts "[Name] joining
as [Job title]". Make sure to select the calendar as GitLab Availability and not your own.
- **Give team member access to the GitLab availability calendar**
Go to your calendar window, under my calendars move your cursor over the calendar
and click the dropdown triangle. Select calendar settings and go to "Share this
calendar" in the top of the window. Enter the GitLab email address and scroll
down to set the permission setting to "make changes to events" Then save in the
lower left corner.
- **Add team member to the GitLab Birthdays calendar**
Go to your calendar window, under my calendar select the GitLab Birthdays calendar. Go to the team member's birthdate and add an all day event with their name as the title. Change the setting to repeat annually. Also add an entry for the team member's work anniversary. Change the color of the event to blue, make it an annual event, and include Name and Work Anniversary in the title. Share this calendar with the new team member.  
- **Add blank entry to team page**<a name="blank-entry"></a>
Login to [Gitlab.com](www.gitlab.com) and go to the www-gitlab-com project. In
the left menu click "Files," select "data," and choose the file called team.yml. In the top right
corner you can click "edit" to make edits to the code. Scroll all the way down
and copy-paste the code of the previous blank entry to the team page. Edit the
fields to the right info of the new hire and find the right job description URL on
the [Jobs](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/) page. Do not include the employee's name in the commit message, only initials.  
 **Note** _This can be tricky, so if you run into trouble reach out to some of
your awesome colleagues in the #questions (channel) on Slack_
- **Add to phishing test platform**
Login to [Knowbe4](https://training.knowbe4.com/). Click on import users. Add the team member's email and import. You do not need to assign them to any groups. Go to the users page and update their email to also reflect their first and last name.
- **Add entry to Team Call agenda**
Open the Team Agenda google doc, and on the starting day add an Agenda item:
"[Hiring manager name]: Welcome [name new team member] joining as [job title]"
as the first item on the agenda. If the new team member is not starting on the next agenda day, add their name to the list of Team Members to be added, and keep an eye out for their start date to add them to the agenda.
- **Invite to team meeting and GitLab 101 meeting**
Go to the team call meeting on the starting date of the team member and the next
scheduled GitLab 101 in the Availability calendar. Click on "edit event" to open.
On the right enter the team member's GitLab email address in the  "add guests"
section and click save. When asked select "all events" to add to all scheduled
meetings and "send" out the invitation.
- **Order business cards**
Go BambooHR and enter the info needed for the Business Cards. This is found by clicking on More, then selecting Business Cards. Select Update Business Card Requests and fill out all the pertinent fields.
Log in with your specific credentials to [MOO](https://www.moo.com/m4b/account/login). Select Create New Packs. Create a blank pack, then go to GitLab packs and select the newly created default. Edit the Title to be the team member's name. Click on the preview to edit the name, job title, email, phone number, twitter handle, and location. Once you have made sure all of the information is correct on the business card you can select how many cards you would like to order (standard is 50) and add the cards to the cart. When you are checking out, update which shipping center you would like the cards sent from at the top right by selecting the proper flag. Enter in the team member's shipping address. Place the order with the applicable shipping and billing addresses.
- **Add team member to Expensify (only with employees)**<a name="add-expensify"></a>
Login to [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/signin) and go to "Admin" in the top menu. Select the right policy based upon the entity that employs the new team member. Select "People" in the left menu. Select "Invite" and add the GitLab email. Edit the message to be sent for the employee. Click "invite". If the team member should be added as an admin to be able to also add new team members, update them to a [domain admin](https://docs.expensify.com/advanced-admin-controls/domain-members-and-groups).
- **Add team member to Beamy**<a name="add-beamy"></a>
Login in to access the settings for the [Beam](https://suitabletech.com/accounts/login/). In the top menu move your cursor over the blue login button. Go to "Manage your beams". Click on "manage" in the lower left corner. Enter the GitLab email and scroll down to find the newly addedd email. Check the box for "Auto connect".
- **Add team member into the Summit info sheets**
Add the team member's name to the proper Google sheet to make sure they enter flight details and will be assigned a room.
- **Add team member to our Egencia platform**<a name="add-egencia"></a>
Log into Egencia and go to the menu option "manage users". Choose "new user account" and fill in the passport name of the new team member.
As username choose the same handle as on our dev domain. Enter the GitLab email address and uncheck the newsletter box.
Lastly assign the department in which the new team member is working.
- **Upgrade team member's Zoom account to Pro**<a name="make-zoom-pro"></a>
Log in to [Zoom](https://gitlab.zoom.us) with the generic admin credentials stored in 1Password. Find the user in the "User Management" tab, and click "edit", then select "Pro" (the default is Basic). If the user does not yet appear in Zoom, add them through the "Add Users" button at the top of the User Management tab. A Pro account allows the individual to have calls longer than 30 minutes. If we've run out of Pro licenses, send an email to our account manager at Zoom, as listed in a shared note on 1Password.
