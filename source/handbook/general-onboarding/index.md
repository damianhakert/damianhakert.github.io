## Onboarding Topics That Apply to Everyone <a name="everyone"></a>
(To be populated more extensively soon)
### General topics.
### Set Yourself Up Securely
<ol>
 <li><b>Never reuse</b> a password you use on a company account (not for another GitLab service or for a personal account).</li>
<li>Set up <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> as your password manager.</li>
<li>Use Lastpass to <a href="https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/generating-a-password/">generate <b>strong passwords</b></a> for any new company accounts.</li>
<li>
<p>
When signing up for a new service ask yourself which team members you need to <b>share access</b> with.
If the service has a built-in way of creating other user accounts, use that.
If not, then store your credentials in an appropriate shared folder on our company LastPass account so that your colleagues can sign in using your credentials.
</p>
<p>
Do not share credentials via email, issue comments, chat etc.
This includes email addresses to login and API keys.
Use LastPass shared folders for this.
You should be invited to a few shared folders.
If you're missing an appropriate folder ask the CEO to create a new shared folder.
Refer to the items with 'NAME OF SITE' in 'LASTPASS FOLDER'.
Do not use the share function in Lastpass itself, use shared folders and email others to altert them if needed.
No not store credentials in a shared folder if everyone has their own user account for the service.
</p>
</li>
<li>Do not let your password manager store the <b>master password</b> (it is ok to store the login).</li>
<li>Enable 2 factor authentication (2FA) with <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> (not SMS) for your Lastpass account, Google, Slack and GitLab accounts.</li>
<li><b>Encrypt</b> your home folder (easy on Ubuntu/Debian, on OS X use FileVault2 full disk encryption).</li>
<li>Set up a screen saver with password <b>lock</b> on your notebook. The timeout can depend on how you use your laptop.</li>
<li><b>Report</b> suspect situations to an officer of the company.</li>
<li>If you have security <b>suggestions</b> put them on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JiLWsTOm0yprPVIW9W-hM4iUsRxkBt_1bpm3VXV4Muc/edit">agenda</a>.</li>
<li>Never <b>dismiss</b> a security report as invalid. Keep asking questions until the researcher comes to the same conclusion or stops responding.</li>
<li>Do not <b>forward</b> company emails (@gitlab.com) to a non-company email address.</li>
<li>Do not click on links in emails you did not request yourself (requested password reset is OK, anything else is suspect), we use <a href="https://cuttlephish.com/">CuttleFish</a> to test our behaviour on this. Clicking itself is a problem even when you don't enter a password, because a visit can already be used to execute a zero day.</li>
</ol>
