## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires <a name="checklist"></a>

Create issue for new hire in organization with following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue.
When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task.

```
