## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires
<a name="checklist"></a>

Create issue for new hire in organization with following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue.
When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task. Please update this list as more steps arise, and then also update the associated item on the [offboarding list](/handbook/offboarding).

```
### BEFORE STARTING AT GITLAB

1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): Once the contract is signed, as soon as possible, create issue called 'Onboarding (NAME), starting (DATE), as (ROLE)' in [organization](https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/organization/issues) with relevant lines of the master checklist, paste the private email address of the hire in there and /cc @brittany, @nvatalidis, and @sasha.
1. [ ] Hiring manager is (FILL IN WITH @ HANDLE), buddy is (FILL IN WITH @HANDLE (Nominate someone preferably in similar timezone but different functional group, try to pair engineering and non-engineering if possible)), and People Ops is tackled by (FILL IN WITH @ HANDLE).
1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): Send an email to the chosen buddy letting them know that they have been chosen and include a link to the onboarding issue.
1. [ ] Buddy: Schedule video call for first day to introduce yourself, and make sure they know that if they have questions, they can come to you. Check with the new team member if they will need help setting up their SSH key and installing a Shell ready for using Git locally. You may need to setup an additional meeting for this step. But your main job as a buddy will be to direct them to the right parts of the handbook, and/or encourage them to ask their questions of the wider group on chat, etc.
1. [ ] Google account
   1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): [create Google account](https://admin.google.com/gitlab.com/AdminHome?pli=1&fral=1#UserList:org=49bxu3w3zb11yx), `firstname[at]gitlab.com` or `initial(s)[at]gitlab.com`, email instructions to private email address, comment with private email below this issue.
   1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): Add new Google user to ['New Users' group](https://admin.google.com/gitlab.com/AdminHome?groupId=new-users@gitlab.com&chromeless=1#OGX:Group) to disable 2FA for them
   1. [ ] New team member: Google does not support 2FA in some countries ([e.g. Nigeria](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/3_wcd8tAqdc) ); if that is the case for you, reach out to People Ops to get the initial authentication code sent to a phone in  supported country, after which 2FA will work as normal.
   1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): inform Hiring manager that Google account has been created by mentioning them with a comment in the issue.
