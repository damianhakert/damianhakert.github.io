## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires <a name="checklist"></a>

Create issue for new hire in organization with following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue.
When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task.

```

### GitLab Instances<a name="gitlab-instances"></a>
We have two GitLab instances that we use primarily, namely the 'dev' server and the free SaaS of GitLab at GitLab.com.

#### dev.gitlab.org
* This server is only accessible to people from GitLab the company.
* This is the instance we use for customers development.
* In addition, all our internal (company) issues are found here as well.
* This server is updated from master every night, so we quickly see if we broke something.
* Often referred to as `dev`.

#### GitLab.com
* This is the SaaS of GitLab. Everyone can host their repository for free here and
this is where the majority of open source contributions come in. Unless there's
a good reason not to (customer information disclosure, undisclosed security
issues, etc.), do your development and submit your merge requests here [in the open](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/08/03/almost-everything-we-do-is-now-open/).

#### Other instances
Many developers set up their own private GitLab instance somewhere, for instance
to test and work with LDAP or Active Directory, to give demos, or for various
other reasons.

### Security<a name="security"></a>

See the [security handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security).

### Quiz<a name="quiz"></a>
Employees should answer GitLab quiz questions in the first 2 weeks of working in
the company. If the answers are not accurate, you may retest once: [GitLab Quiz](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/questions/)
Please schedule a call with your hiring manager.
