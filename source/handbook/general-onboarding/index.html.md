## Onboarding How To

### Welcome to GitLab

Congratulations on completing the interview process, and starting your first day at GitLab. We are so excited that you are here! This page is designed to help you navigate the onboarding process from reading the handbook, to completing the onboarding issue. Regardless of your role, we all use GitLab, and if you come from a non-technical background, this might be new to you! At times the onboarding issue might feel overwhelming, but if you have any additional questions along the way, please feel free to ask [People Ops](/handbook/people-operations/), your buddy, or anyone else at GitLab in the `#questions` channel on Slack.

### Your First Day

Throughout your first few days at GitLab it is important to focus on the onboarding issue; but where to start! This guide will help you understand what is in the onboarding issue, and why we are asking you to complete the items on the issue.

#### Getting Started

* Prepare for your first [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#team-call). In the calendar invite is a link to the Team Call agenda. This holds what we will be talking about that day, as well as the order of Team Monday-Thursday at the top of that page. If you are curious when you will get to share what you have been up to, you can look there.

* Connect with GitLab's social media sites:
  1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gitlab-com)
  1. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab)
  1. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gitlab)
  1. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMGQ8QHMAnVIsI3xJrihhg)

#### Working Remotely

1. The first month at a remote company can be hard. Take a look at [3 Things I Learned in My First Month at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/11/02/three-things-I-learned-in-my-first-month-at-gitlab/) for some insight from a GitLabber.

### The Onboarding Issue

In the onboarding issue, we ask you to complete a variety of tasks. Here are some [tips](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips) on items like gmail, zoom, calendly, etc. The onboarding issue can be seen at the bottom of this page.

#### 1Password

We recommend that you set up your 1Password account early in the onboarding process since you will need it to hold all of the new passwords that you will create. This is an awesome tool, that GitLab uses to store all passwords for each department. You will also have your personal vault where you can store all the passwords that you are creating for GitLab. In keeping with our [security best practices](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/). We ask that you do set up this 1Password account with your GitLab email, even though you might have one already.

#### 2FA

GitLab asks you to enable 2FA (2-Step Verification, also known as two-factor authentication), because it adds an extra layer of security to your account. You sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone). If you have problem with 2FA just let people ops know! We can disable it for you to then set it up again. If the problem persists, then we can direct you to one of our super admins.

#### BambooHR and TriNet

BambooHR is our HRIS (Human Resource Information System) for all team members. We have self-service enabled so that at any time you can access your account to see your employment information and documentation. As part of onboarding, please make sure to update everything that is applicable to you on the Personal tab, your ethnicity (which is located on the Jobs tab), and emergency contact information. We also ask that you provide People Ops with a Photo ID which is used for Employment Verification Purposes. You can send this documentation in any way you feel most comfortable. Some common ways in the past have been emailing People Ops, sending as a direct message to our People Ops Specialist in Slack, or scheduling a call with our People Ops Specialist to view the documentation.

The information from BambooHR is used to feed other systems, so it is important that it is filled out before you start. If you are a GitLab Inc. employee, you will receive login information from TriNet, our payroll and benefits provider, within 24 hours of your start date.

##### GitLab.com vs Dev.GitLab.org

The dev server is only viewable to team members, and is used by the Development team (amongst others). Per the [GitLab workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#gitlab-workflow) point 9, everything that can be public should be out in the open. GitLab.com is viewable to anyone with an account. We ask you to set up your GitLab.com account with your GitLab email for additional security.

##### Calendly

Calendly is a calendar tool that allows individuals to select open meeting slots in order to speak with others at the company. (Great for also setting up coffee breaks!) All team members add Calendly to their Slack profile as a part of onboarding, so if you ever need or want to speak with another team member, you can schedule the meeting yourself. When you are setting up Calendly, there is no specific GitLab account. With the free version you will only be allowed one meeting time, but if you need to upgrade to a Pro account, you can do so and expense it per [spending company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money).

##### Egencia

You will receive an email to set up your account for Egencia. This travel is for company purposes, and is paid for by the company at the time of booking. For more information on setting up your account please visit our [travel page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/travel/#booking-travel-and-lodging-with-egencia).

#### Add yourself to the team page

We are happy to have you join our company and to include
you in our [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/). The following are
the steps to add yourself to the team page. Please follow the links that will guide you to full guides about every step. If you are not familiar with local git yet, feel free to do this through the web interface, and ask anyone at the company questions along the way.

##### Add on GitLab.com

1. As part of your onboarding issue, you created an account on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/). take note of your username and password, because you will need them throughout these steps.

### Reading the Handbook

A core value of GitLab is documentation. Therefore, everything that we do, we have documented on about.gitlab.com. This can make the handbook seem huge! Don't let it scare you. To simplify navigating the handbook here are some suggested steps. Feel free to take a wrong turn at any time to learn more about whatever you are interested in.

1. Read [about](https://about.gitlab.com/about/) the company, and [How we use GitLab to build GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/07/07/how-we-use-gitlab-to-build-gitlab/). It is important to understand our [culture](/culture), and how the organization was started. If you have any questions about company products you can always check out our [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/#compare) and [products](https://about.gitlab.com/products/).
1. Tackle general section of the [handbook](/handbook/). Here are some highlights that are important for new hires to pay attention to:
  * Make sure to read over our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values) and [general guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines) to answer any questions you might have about what to do and when.
  * If you have questions about what is in the handbook check out the [handbook usage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage) as well as your own department's sub-page of the handbook (which can be found at the top of the handbook).
  * [Communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication) is extremely important within a remote only organization. Read through the guidelines to understand how we make [working remotely](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/working-remotely) successful.
  * Don't forget to comply with the contract you signed, and make sure you understand [Intellectual Property](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-guidelines/#intellectual-property).
1. Since we are a global organization understand your benefits might be different than other team members at the company based on which [contract](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/) you signed. It is important to understand **your** [benefits](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/benefits/). If you have questions please reach out to People Ops.
  * Notable Benefits that apply to all team members:
    1. [Unlimited Time Off Policy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/paid-time-off): GitLab truly does value a work-life balance, and encourages team members to have a flexible schedule and take vacations. If you feel uncomfortable about taking time off, or are not sure how much time to take off throughout the year, feel free to speak with your manager or People Operations. We will be happy to reinforce this policy! Please note the additional steps that might need to be taken if you are scheduled for [on call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/on-call).
    1. Check out [People Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/) to learn more about our [policies](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/#policies).
    1. As part of onboarding, you received an email asking if you needed any equipment. Throughout your time at GitLab you might need additional equipment, would like to learn how to code, or want to visit a team member! Make sure you know what you can [spend company money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/spending-company-money) on.
    1. The handbook also describes [incentives](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/incentives) such as sales, dinners, or bonuses, that can apply to all GitLab team members. Know any great talent to refer?
1. Even if you come from a technical background, it is important to understand the [proper workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#gitlab-workflow) since this is how we are all able to operate remotely in a successful way. If you come from a non-technical background, and would like more clarification on what this workflow means, feel free to ask People Ops, your manager, or anyone else at the company.

#### Learning Git and GitLab

If you need any help with Git itself, subscribe to the `#git-help` channel on Slack and feel free to ask any question you might have.

#### 60-day Onboarding Survey

To help PeopleOps understand your experience and improve the onboarding process, please complete the 60-day [onboarding survey] (https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU8qxThxRu3tdrExFGBJ1GlyucCoJj2kDpcvOlM4AiRGOavQ/viewform) after you have been working for GitLab for more than 2 months! PeopleOps will send monthly reminders to team members to complete the survey!

### Questions?

At any time if you have questions, please ask your manager, buddy, People Ops, or anyone else at the company!


Please add to me. Questions that were not answered? Something that is not clear? Please create an issue or a merge request and assign it to People Ops to make this documentation better for the next new team member.

## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires
{: #checklist}

Create issue for new hire in organization with following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue.
When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task. Please update this list as more steps arise, and then also update the associated item on the [offboarding list](/handbook/offboarding).

```
### BEFORE STARTING AT GITLAB

1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): Once the contract is signed, as soon as possible, create a **confidential** issue called 'Onboarding (NAME), starting (DATE), as (ROLE)' in the [People Ops issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues) with relevant lines of the master checklist, paste the private email address of the hire in there and /cc @brittanyr and @sashab, and the GitLab.com handle of the new team member if known.
1. [ ] Hiring manager is (FILL IN WITH @ HANDLE), buddy is (FILL IN WITH @HANDLE (Nominate someone preferably in similar timezone but different functional group, try to pair engineering and non-engineering if possible)), and People Ops is tackled by (FILL IN WITH @ HANDLE).
1. [ ] People Ops (Recruiter): Send an email to the chosen buddy letting them know that they have been chosen and include a link to the onboarding issue.
