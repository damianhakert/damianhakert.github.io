## Master Checklist for Onboarding of New Hires
<a name="checklist"></a>

Create issue for new hire in organization with following checklist.
This list looks strange in this handbook but this is to ensure you can copy paste it into an issue.
When you paste it in an issue it will have checkboxes that you can click to complete.
The topics are ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled, and the main person responsible is called out at the beginning of each task. Please update this list as more steps arise, and then also update the associated item on the [offboarding list](/handbook/offboarding).

```

1. Find the dropdown menu at the top of your screen and find the branch
that you previously created to add your picture (they are in alphabetical
order). If you don't have a branch yet, follow the steps to [create a new
branch](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/gitlab-basics/create-branch.html).

1. Information displayed on [Team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/) is
pulled from a data file. You can find it by clicking on each of the following items: `data/` and then `team.yml`.
1. When you are in `team.yml`, click on “edit” on the top right side of
your screen.
1. Your information should already be added after the last person on the team page. Update the initials to be your `Firstname 'Nickname' Lastname`. Verify that your title is entered correctly. Add the file name of the picture that you uploaded previously. Enter your twitter and gitlab handle. Write a story about yourself.
Don't forget to use other team members' information as a reference and to
respect the spaces between lines. Please don't use "tab" because it will break the page format.
1. After you added your information, add a comment to your commit and click on “Commit Changes”.
1. Go to the Merge Request that you previously created with the branch that you are using and assign it to your manager for review.
