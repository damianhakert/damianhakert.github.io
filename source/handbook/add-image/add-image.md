title: "How to add an image"
---

The following are the steps to add images to your repository in [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com):

Find the image that you’d like to add.

In your computer files, find the GitLab.com project to which you'd like to add the image (you'll find it as a regular file). Click on every file until you find exactly where you'd like to add the image. There, paste the image.

Go to your shell or Terminal, and add the following commands:

* To find the correct file, add this command for every file that you'd like to open until you reach the file where you added your image:
```
cd NAME-OF-FILE-YOU'D-LIKE-TO-OPEN
```

* Create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

* Check if your image was correctly added to the file:
```
ls
```

You should see the name of the image in the list shown.

* Go back one file:
```
cd ../
```

* Check the status and you should see your image’s name in red:
```
git status
```

* Add your changes:
```
git add NAME-OF-YOUR-IMAGE
```

* Check the status and you should see your image’s name in green:
```
git status
```

* Add the commit:
```
git commit -m “DESCRIBE COMMIT IN A FEW WORDS”
```

* Send your changes to GitLab.com:
```
git push origin NAME-OF-BRANCH
```

Your image should've been added to your repository in GitLab.com.
