## Guidelines

- As a leader team members will follow your behavior, always do the right thing.
- Behavior should be consistent inside and outside the company, don't fake it outside, just do the right thing inside the company as well.
- In tough times people will put it in their best efforts when they do it for eachother.
- When times are great be a voice of moderation, when times are bad be a voice of hope.
- A span of control should be around 7, from 4 to 10. Lower means too many generals and too few soldiers. Higher means you don't have time for 1:1's anymore.
- We work async, lead by example and make sure people understand that things need to be written down in issues as they happen.
- Start meetings on time, be on time yourself, don't ask if everyone is there, and don't punish people at showed up on time by waiting anyone.
- We have a simple hierarchy, everyone has one boss that is experienced in their subject matter. Matrix organizations are too hard.
- We don't have project managers. The individual contributors need to manage themselves.
- We are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions. But in the end one person decides the matter after have listened to all the feedback.
- It is encouraged to disagree and have a constructive confrontation, but it is "disagree & commit", when a decision is taken you make it happen.
- We avoid meetings because those aren't supporting the asynchronous work flow, are hard to conduct due to timezone differences, are inclusive - 
making it harder to share with the community, are usually inefficient and aren't continous.
