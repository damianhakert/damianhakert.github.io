## Guidelines

- As a leader team members will follow your behavior, always do the right thing.
- Behavior should be consistent inside and outside the company, don't fake it outside, just do the right thing inside the company as well.
- In tough times people will put it in their best efforts when they do it for eachother.
- When times are great be a voice of moderation, when times are bad be a voice of hope.
- A span of control should be around 7, from 4 to 10. Lower means too many generals and too few soldiers. Higher means you don't have time for 1:1's anymore.
