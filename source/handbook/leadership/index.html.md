## Guidelines

### Leadership Qualities
- Honesty - Whatever ethical plane you hold yourself to, when you are responsible for a team of people, its important to raise the bar even higher. Your business and its employees are a reflection of yourself, and if you make honest and ethical behavior a key value, your team will follow suit.
- Delegate -  It is important to remember that trusting your team with your idea is a sign of strength, not weakness. Delegating tasks to the appropriate departments is one of the most important skills you can develop as your business/team grows.
- Communication - Knowing what you want accomplished may seem clear in your head, but if you try to explain it to someone else and are met with a blank expression, you know there is a problem. Being able to clearly and succinctly describe what you want done is extremely important. If you can’t relate your vision to your team, you won’t all be working towards the same goal.
- Confidence - Part of your job as a leader is to put out fires and maintain the team morale. Keep up your confidence level, and assure everyone that setbacks are natural and the important thing is to focus on the larger goal. As the leader, by staying calm and confident, you will help keep the team feeling the same. Remember, your team will take cues from you, so if you exude a level of calm damage control, your team will pick up on that feeling.
- Positive Attitude - You want to keep your team motivated towards the continued success of the company, and keep the energy levels up. 
- Commitment - There is no greater motivation than seeing the boss down in the trenches working alongside everyone else, showing that hard work is being done on every level. By proving your commitment to the brand and your role, you will not only earn the respect of your team, but will also instill that same hardworking energy among your staff. It’s important to show your commitment not only to the work at hand, but also to your promises.
- Creativity - Some decisions will not always be so clear-cut. Thnk outside the box and encourage others to think outside the box.  
- Intuition - Learning to trust yourself is as important as your team learning to trust you.
- Inspire - Being able to inspire your team is great for focusing on the future goals. It is your job to keep spirits up, and that begins with an appreciation for the hard work.
- Approach - Not all human beings are the same. You must have the ability to customize your approach on a person by person basis, based on the situation at hand. You also must be apporachable to others.


- As a leader team members will follow your behavior, always do the right thing.
- Behavior should be consistent inside and outside the company, don't fake it outside, just do the right thing inside the company as well.
- In tough times people will put it in their best efforts when they do it for each other.
- When times are great be a voice of moderation, when times are bad be a voice of hope.
- A span of control should be around 7, from 4 to 10. Lower means too many generals and too few soldiers. Higher means you don't have time for 1:1's anymore.
- We work async, lead by example and make sure people understand that things need to be written down in issues as they happen.
- Start meetings on time, be on time yourself, don't ask if everyone is there, and don't punish people at showed up on time by waiting anyone.
- We have a simple hierarchy, everyone has one boss that is experienced in their subject matter. Matrix organizations are too hard.
- We don't have project managers. The individual contributors need to manage themselves.
- We are not a democratic or consensus driven company. People are encouraged to give their comments and opinions. But in the end one person decides the matter after have listened to all the feedback.
- It is encouraged to disagree and have a constructive confrontation, but it is "disagree & commit", when a decision is taken you make it happen.
- We give feedback, lots of it, don't hold back on suggestions to improve.
- If you praise someone try to do it in front of an audience, if you give suggestions to improve do it 1 on 1.
- If you meet external people always ask what they think we should improve.
- As soon as you know you'll have to let someone go, do it immediately. The team member is entitled to knowing where they stand. Delaying it for days or weeks causes problems with confidentiality (find out that they will be let go), causation (attributing it to another reason), and escalation (the working relation is probably going downhill).
- When someone says they are considering to quit drop everything and listen to them by asking questions to find out what their concerns are. If you delay the person will not feel valued and the decision will be irreversible.
- People should not be raised or given a title because they ask for it or threaten to quit. We should proactively raise and promote people without people asking. If you do it when people ask you are disadvantaging people that don't ask and you'll end up with many more people asking.
- Don't refer to team members [as family](https://hbr.org/2014/06/your-company-is-not-a-family). It is great that our team feels like a close-knit group and we should encourage that. But families don't have an an [offboarding process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/offboarding/).
- We avoid meetings because those aren't supporting the asynchronous work flow, are hard to conduct due to timezone differences and are limited only to those attending them, making it harder to share.
- Praise and credit the work of your reports to the rest of the company, never present it as your own. This and many other great lessons in [an ask metafilter thread worth reading](http://ask.metafilter.com/300002/My-best-manager-did-this).

## No matrix organization

We believe everyone deserves to report to exactly one person and that knows and understands what you do day to day.
We don't want a matrix organizations where you work with a lead day to day but formally report to someone else.
The advantage of our structure for team members is that you get great feedback, and that your career progress is based on your impact.
For the organization forgoing a separate class of managers ensures a simple structure with clear responsibilities.
It reduces compensation costs, coordination costs, and office politics.
The disadvantage is that your manager has a limited amount of time for you and probably has less experience managing people.
To mitigate these disadvantages we should offer ample training, coaching, support structures, and processes to ensure our managers can handle these tasks correctly and in limited amount of time.
Everyone deserves a great boss that helps you with your career, lets you know when you should improve, hires a great team, and motivates and coaches you to get the best out of you.
