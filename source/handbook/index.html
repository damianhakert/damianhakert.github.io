          <ol>
            <li>Working at GitLab B.V. is cooperating with the most talented people you've ever worked with, being the <b>most productive</b> you'll ever be, creating software that is helping the most people you've ever reached.</li>
            <li>We recognize that inspiration is perishable, if youâ€™re <b>enthusiastic</b> about something that generates great results in relatively little time feel free to work on that.</li>
            <li>Do what is right for our <b>customers</b> and the rest of the GitLab community, do what is best over the long term, don't be evil.</li>
            <li>We create <b>simple</b> software to accomplish complex collaborative tasks.</li>
            <li>Do <b>not</b> make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin colour, gender or sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>Use <b>inclusive</b> language. For example, prefer 'Hi everybody' or 'Hi people' to 'Hi guys'.</li>
            <li>Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and <b>speak up</b>.</li>
            <li>Work out in the <b>open</b>, try to use public issue trackers and repositories when possible.</li>
            <li>Share solutions you find and answers you receive with the <b>whole community</b>.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake, don't worry, correct it and <b>proactively</b> let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it and how, if needed, you changed the process to prevent future mistakes.</li>
            <li>You can always <b>refuse</b> to deal with people that treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Everyone can <b>remind</b> anyone in the company about the above points. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.</li>
            <li>If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer) please let your boss,or the CEO, know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are <b>small</b>.</li>
            <li>We want to have a great company so if you meet people that are <b>better</b> than yourself try to recruit them to join the company.</li>
            <li>It is easier to bond with people that have the same constraints, compensate for this and recognize that sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.</li>
            <li>Our strategy is detailed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1tco4-arhiA3V-XUJAkTtJ6zrfvT0OrUHtID2S1qVsXE/edit">GitLab Strategy document</a>, please read it and contribute.</li>
            <li>Explicitly note what <b>next action</b> you propose or expect and from who.</li>
            <li>There is no need for <b>consensus</b>, make sure that you give people that might have good insights a chance to respond (by /cc'ing them) but make a call yourself, <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/585950222703992833">consensus doesn't scale</a>.</li>
            <li>If you need to discuss with a team member for help please realize that probably the majority of the community also doesn't know, be sure to <b>document</b> the answer to radiate this information to the whole community. After the question is answered discuss where it should be documented and who will do it. You can remind other people of this by asking where/who?</li>
            <li>If you fix something for GitLab.com or one of our users make sure to make that the default (preferred) and radiate the information in the docs, we should run GitLab.com with the default settings and setup our users would also have.</li>
            <li>Be <b>specific</b> in your written communication, especially externally. Do not reply with a generalization when you can give an example.</li>
            <li>Be <b>kind</b> in your written communication, especially externally. Be constructive instead of argumentative or condescending.</li>
            <li>Everyone at the company cares about your output. Being away from the keyboard during the workday, doing private browsing or making personal phone calls is fine and encouraged.</li>
            <li>We're a distributed company where people work remote without missing out, prefer communication in public issues and chat channels and ensure conclusions of offline conversations are written down.</li>

          <h2 id="gitlab-workflow">GitLab Workflow</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>All written communication happens in English, even when sent one on one, sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.</li>
            <li>Always <b>create</b> an issue for things you work on. If it is worth spending time on it is worth creating an issue for it since that enables other people to learn and help. You can always edit the description or close it when the problem is something different or disappears.</li>
            <li><b>'Double check'</b> issues to prevent internal confusion and us failing to report back to the reporters. For example, open an issue with link to ZenDesk and close the issue with copy of the response. Or add 'Report: ' lines to the description with links to relevant issues and feature requests and ensure they are closed and note this with a comment. If you are not responsible for reporting back please do not close an issue, instead reassign it.</li>
            <li>If issues are related <b>crosslink</b> them (a link from each issue to the other one). Put the links at the top of the issues' description with a short mention of the relationship (Report, etc.). If there are more than 2 issues use one issue as the central one and crosslink all issues to this one. Please, also crosslink between Zendesk and GitLab issues.</li>
            <li>Give the community the <b>chance to help</b>. For example: place issues on the feedback tracker, leave comments in rake check tests about what you can run manually and ask 'can you send a merge request to fix this?'.</li>
            <li>Do not leave issues open for a long time, issues should be <b>actionable</b> and realistic. If you are assigned but don't have time mention it to someone. If nobody is assigned and it is not a priority please ensure the community can help and close it.</li>
            <li>Make a conscious effort to <b>prioritize</b> your work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: is there a team member waiting for the answer, what is the impact if you delay it, how many people does it affect, etc. What follows is a general guideline from urgent to less urgent:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Emergency</b> issues from standard or plus subscribers.</li>
                <li><b>Security</b> issues.</li>
                <li><b>Data integrity</b> (not losing data).</li>
                <li><b>Availability</b> of GitLab.com.</li>
                <li><b>Subscriber</b> questions.</li>
                <li><b>Regression</b> issues.</li>
                <li><b>Consultancy</b> work.</li>
                <li><b>Promised</b> features.</li>
                <li><b>Growth</b> efforts.</li>
                <li><b>Other</b> work.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Pick issues from the current milestone and only assign issues to yourself when you start to work on them.</li>
            <li>We keep our <b>promises</b> and do not make external promises without internal agreement.</li>
            <li>We try not to assign issues but to have people <b>pick issues</b> in a milestone themselves, do not pick one until you are actually working on it.</li>
            <li>Even when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment early and prevent rework. Mark it <a href="http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/workflow/wip_merge_requests.html">WIP</a> so it is not merged by accident.</li>
            <li>If you are assigned to merge a Merge Request and there is a merge conflict, consider trying to resolve it <b>yourself</b> instead of asking the MR creator to resolve the conflict. If it is easy to resolve you avoid a round trip between you and the creator, and the MR gets merged sooner. This is a suggestion, not an obligation.</li>
            <li>When you create a merge request, please <b>mention</b> the issue that it solves in the description but avoid auto closing it by saying Fixes #1 or Solves #1. Since we frequently have to report back to customers or the rest of the community, issues are not done when the code is merged.</li>
            <li>If you ask a question to a specific person, always start the comment by mentioning them; this will ensure they see it if their notification level is mentioned and other people will understand they don't have to respond.</li>

          <h2 id="non-gitlab-workflow">Non-GitLab Workflow</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Use <b>asynchronous communication</b> when possible (issues and email instead of chat), issues are preferred over email, email is preferred over Slack.</li>
            <li>If you have to use email please send one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).</li>
            <li>Always reply to emails, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.</li>
            <li>If you forward an email without other comments please add FYI (for your information) or FYA (for your action).</li>
            <li>If you use Slack, please use a public channel whenever possible, mention the person you want to reach if it is urgent. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, and easy to involve other people, if needed.</li>
            <li>All company data should be <b>sharable</b> by default. Don't use a local text file but leave comments on an issue. Create Google docs with your company Google Apps account.</li>
            <li>Do not close an issue until it has been <b>reported</b> back to all parties and issue trackers updated.</li>
            <li>If there are materials relevant for a calandar meeting (for example a Google Doc) please add the url to the meeting invite description.</li>
            <li>If you want to schedule time with a teammember for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the teammember only, after they respond yes then invite outside people.</li>
            <li>
              Thank people that did a great job in our 'Thanks' channel on Slack.
              If someone is an employee just "@" mention them.
              If multiple people were working on something try mentioning each person by "@" name. 'Thanks everyone' does not say much.
              If someone is not an employee mention our office manager, their name, a quirky gift and link to their work.
              For example: <i>"@sylvia Joe deserves a lawnmower for LINK"</i>.
              The office manager will approach the people for their address saying we want to send some swag.
              We'll ship it in gift wrap with "Thanks for your great work on LINK, love from @gitlab".
              Don't thank the CEO or other executives for something that the company paid for, thank GitLab instead.

          <ol>
            <li><b>Never reuse</b> a password you use on a company account (not for another GitLab service or for a personal account).</li>
            <li>Set up <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> as your password manager.</li>
            <li>Use Lastpass to <a href="https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/generating-a-password/">generate <b>strong passwords</b></a> for any new company accounts.</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When signing up for a new service ask your self which team members you need to <b>share access</b> with.
                If the service has a built-in way of creating other user accounts, use that.
                If not then store your credentials in an appropriate shared folder on our company LastPass account so that your colleagues can sign in using your credentials.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do not share credentials via email, issue comments, chat etc.
                This includes email addresses to login and API keys.
                Use LastPass shared folders for this.
                You should be invited to a few shared folders.
                If you're missing an appropriate folder ask the CEO to create a new shared folder.
                Refer to the items with 'NAME OF SITE' in 'LASTPASS FOLDER'.
                Do not use the share function in Lastpass itself, use shared folders and email others to altert them if needed.
                No not store credentials in a shared folder if everyone has their own user account for the service.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Do not let your password manager store the <b>master password</b> (it is ok to store the login).</li>
            <li>Enable 2 factor authentication (2FA) for your Lastpass account, Google, Slack and GitLab accounts.</li>
            <li><b>Encrypt</b> your home folder (easy on Ubuntu/Debian, on OS X use FileVault2 full disk encryption).</li>
            <li>Set up a screen saver with password <b>lock</b> on your notebook. The timeout can depend on how you use your laptop.</li>
            <li><b>Report</b> suspect situations to an officer of the company.</li>
            <li>If you have security <b>suggestions</b> put them on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JiLWsTOm0yprPVIW9W-hM4iUsRxkBt_1bpm3VXV4Muc/edit">agenda</a>.</li>
            <li>Never <b>dismiss</b> a security report as invalid. Keep asking questions until the researcher comes to the same conclusion or stops responding.</li>
            <li>Do not <b>forward</b> company emails (@gitlab.com) to a non-company email address.</li>
            <li>Do not click on links in emails you did not request yourself (requested password reset is OK, anything else is suspect), we use [CuttleFish](https://cuttlephish.com/) to test our behaviour on this. Clicking itself is a problem even when you don't enter a password, because a visit can already be used to execute a zero day.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Don't frown on people taking time off, encourage that people take care of themselves and other.</li>
            <li>Working hours are flexible, you are invited for the team call if you are available, it is every workday from 8:30am to 9:00am Pacific Time (mostly 5:30pm - 6:00pm Central European Time).</li>
            <li>You don't need to take a day off to go to the gym, go grocery shopping, doing household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected and you have urgent tasks and you're able to communicate, just ensure the rest of the team <b>knows</b> and someone can pick up any urgent tasks.</li>
            <li>You do not need to ask for permission to take days off. You do need to ensure that not more than <b>half</b> of the people that can help with availability emergencies (24/7), regular support, sales or development are gone at any moment. You can check for this on the availability calendar, so be sure to add appointments early.</li>
            <li>If someone from the 24/7 team leaves, set up a <b>call</b> two weeks before that so the other people can divide the on-call days.</li>
            <li>Note the days off in your employee <b>doc</b> before you create a calendar appointment. We register time off so that nobody has to feel bad for taking time off. If you want more time off than you have saved (creating a negative allowance) we can discuss this.
            <li>Add an <b>appointment</b> to the GitLab B.V. availability calendar as you know your plans, you can always change it later.</li>
            <li>In case it can be useful add your panned time off as a <b>FYI</b> on the next agenda of the team call.</li>
            <li>We suggest to take the <b>official</b> days off in the country you are currently in. The total of your paid time off should be 32 days per year, <a href="http://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-page/survival-kit/dutch-holidays">Dutch holidays</a> are 9 fixed (23 flexible, total 32), <a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/index.php">USA holidays</a> are 12 fixed  (20 flexible, total 32).  If you want, you can also do a mix of, for example, the Ecuador and US holidays.</li>
            <li>We will <b>help</b> clients during official days off, unless they are official days off in both the Netherlands and the U.S. We try to have people working who are in a country that don't have an official day off. If you need to work during an official day off in your country, you get a day off allowance in return.</li>
            <li>Accumulated time off will not be <b>paid</b> out, but it does not expire, either.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Keep conversations positive, friendly, real and productive while adding value.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post, just make it clear that you have done so.</li>
            <li>There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You donâ€™t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.</li>
            <li>Answer questions, thank people even if itâ€™s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.</li>
            <li>Appreciate suggestions and feedback.</li>
            <li>Don't make promises that you can't keep.</li>
            <li>Guide users who ask for help and share links. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2014/12/08/explaining-gitlab-bugs/">Types of requests</a>.</li>
            <li>If someone gives a suggestion, guide them to the <a href="http://feedback.gitlab.com/forums/176466-general">Feature Request Forum</a>.</li>
            <li>When facing negative comment respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2015/05/20/gitlab-gitorious-free-software/">the strongest supporters</a>.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>Do not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste, use markdown instead.</li>
            <li>Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to, such as: "GitLab CI source installation documentation".</li>
            <li>Always us ISO dates in all writing and legal documents, yyyy-mm-dd, e.g., 2015-04-13, and never 04-13-2015 or l3-04-2015</li>
            <li>If you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them to make replies easier.</li>
            <li>In urls, always prefer hyphens to underscores.</li>
            <li>Always write GitLab with a capitalized G and L, even when writing GitLab.com.</li>
            <li>When stating monetary amounts shouldn't have one digit, so prefer $19.90 to $19.9</li>
            <li>If an email needs a response but the ask at the top of it.</li>
            <li>If you use headers properly format them (## in markdown, 'Heading 2' in Google docs), start at the second header level because header level 1 is for titles, do not end headers with a colon.</li>
            <li>Read our <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc_styleguide.md">Documentation Styleguide</a> for more information when writing documentation.</li>
