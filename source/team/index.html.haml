        More than 1200 people have #{link_to('contributed to GitLab', 'http://contributors.gitlab.com/')}.
        The GitLab Inc. team consists of the following #{data.team.size} team members and their
        #{link_to("#{data.pets.size} pets", '/team-pets')}.
        We're a #{link_to('remote only', 'http://www.remoteonly.org/')} organization
        and we currently have team members in #{data.team.group_by(&:country).size} countries.
        This page lists who people report to, and on a separate page we
        detail the #{link_to('team structure', '/team/structure')}.
        You can get a sense of the team culture by visiting our
        #{link_to('culture page', '/culture')}.
