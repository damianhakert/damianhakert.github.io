Draft team structure, this is to be finished after the Austin Summit (end of May 2016).

GitLab Inc. has at most four layers in the team structure:

1. CEO
1. Executives (e-team) consisting of CxO's and VP's
1. Leads
1. Individual contributors (IC's)

The indentation below reflects the reporting relations.
You can see our complete team and who reports to who on the [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).
If there is a hyphen (-) in a line the part before hyphen is the name of the department and sometimes links to the relevant part of the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
The job titles link to the job descriptions.
Our open vacancies are at our [jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/).
