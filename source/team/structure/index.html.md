GitLab Inc. has at most five layers in the team structure:

1. CEO
1. Executives (e-team) consisting of CxO's and VP's
1. Directors
1. Leads
1. Individual contributors (IC's), which can be a [specialist](/jobs/specialist/) in one thing and be an [expert](/jobs/expert/) in multiple things.

The indentation below reflects the reporting relations. See a [graph of the organization chart](/team/structure/org-chart/).
You can see our complete team and who reports to whom on the [team page](https://about.gitlab.com/team/).

If there is one individual for a role this person is named here, if there are multiple there only is a link to a function description in order to reduce the duplication with the team page.
If there is a hyphen (-) in a line the part before hyphen is the name of the department and sometimes links to the relevant part of the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/).
The job titles link to the job descriptions.
Our open vacancies are at our [jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/).
