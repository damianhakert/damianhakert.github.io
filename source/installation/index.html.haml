          %h2{:id => "#omnibus"} Omnibus package installation (recommended)
          %p
            We recommend installing the Omnibus package instead of installing GitLab from source.
            %a{:href => "https://twitter.com/awc737/status/517902687052898305"} Omnibus GitLab takes just 2 minutes to install
            and is packaged in the popular deb and rpm formats.
            Compared to an installation from source, the Omnibus package is faster to install and upgrade, more reliable to upgrade and maintain, and it shortens the response time for our subscribers' issues.
            A package contains GitLab and all its depencies (Ruby, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Unicorn, etc.), it can be installed without an internet connection.

          %p
            One-click installers are frequently out of date and might not contain our Omnibus packages.
            An example of this are the Bitnami packages in the past couldn't be updated and are now much harder to update than the Omnibus packages.
            We advise to
            %b not use one-click installers
            but instead start an vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 instance and use the recommended Omnibus package installation.
            This is almost as quick as a one-click install and you're sure of the latest version and easy upgrades.
