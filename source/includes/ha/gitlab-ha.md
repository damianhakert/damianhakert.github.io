title: GitLab High Availability
---

High availability (HA) is a system design that ensures a prearranged level of
operational performance throughout a specific time-period. The most
common way to measure HA is through the notion of uptime, which measures
how long a service is up and running.

GitLab provides a service that is usually essential to most
organizations: it enables people to collaborate on code in a timely
fashion. Any downtime should therefore be short and planned. Luckily,
GitLab provides a solid setup even on a single server without special
measures. And because of the distributed nature of git developers can
still commit code locally even when GitLab is not available. However,
some GitLab features such as the issue tracker and Continuous
Integration are not available when GitLab is down.

**Keep in mind that all Highly Available solutions come with a
trade-off between cost/complexity and uptime**. The more uptime you
want, the more complex the solution. And the more complex the solution,
the more work is involved in setting up and maintaining it. High
availability is not free and every HA solution should balance the costs
against the benefits.

## High Availability for you

The two questions that you need to ask yourself are:

1.  What are my specific needs for code availability?
2.  What complexity level can my organization handle?

HA solutions range from a cheap and simple back-up to highly complex and
costly master-master configurations. When it comes to HA, there is
unfortunately no way to split between an increase in complexity and an
increase in cost.

We recommend that you thoroughly analyze the benefits of an HA solution
against its costs. Most organizations select a High Availability
solution for GitLab that is less complex than the one they use for their
primary customer-facing infrastructure that directly generates revenue.
**It is important that you always choose something that you have
experience with and will test regularly**. A badly implemented HA
solution causes more downtime than it solves. For example the [DRBD user
guide] states:

>By configuring auto-recovery policies, you are effectively
configuring automatic data-loss!

It is more cost effective to go from a simple solution to a more complex one
than the other way around. Therefore, we suggest you work your way up from the
simplest solution and see what works best for you.

**Zero downtime upgrades (including 'rolling' upgrades on a cluster)**
can be achieved with any of the following configurations if there are no
database schema changes that require the node(s) to be shut down. If
there are database changes that are not backwards compatible then a live
or rolling upgrade is not possible. Database changes are noted in the
Upgrade Barometer of each release blog post.

Also see our [technical documentation][ha-docs] on how to configure the
components of a highly available system.

## Maturity levels

### Backup of files and Database

It is possible to automatically backup the GitLab repositories,
configuration, and the database. You can manage backups with the [GitLab
backup tasks]: create a backup with `gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:create` and
restore it with `gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore`. In case the server
becomes unavailable, then the backup can be used to restore the GitLab
installation. This solution is appropriate for teams that have a single
metal server at their disposal.

**We recommend you store the backup at an external location. Also we
recommend automating the backup task and monitoring its successful completion.**

### Recovery from snapshot

It is possible to create a snapshot of your working server. The snapshot
is a copy of all the files on the server, and is taken periodically. In
case of failure, the server is manually reverted to the latest available
snapshot. If a secondary location is available, then it is possible to
automatically revert to the snapshot, without the need for human
intervention.

It is common to do this with virtual machines; most providers have
functionality for taking snapshots. However it is also possible to use
the XFS filesystem to take snapshots.

Recovering from a snapshot is faster than recovering from a backup as
described above. In the latter case, you’d commonly need to re-install
GitLab, manually restore any customization, and only then then run
`gitlab-rake gitlab:backup:restore`. Restoring from a snapshot skips these
extra manual steps.

If you use the snapshot to restore the GitLab server to another machine
one should consider the IP address implications. To make sure everyone
can quickly use the new server it is common to update the DNS entry. In
this case either the new machine has to use a new IP address, or the
snapshot should use the same OpenSSH server certificate as the server it
is replacing. Otherwise users accessing GitLab using the Git client over
SSH will see “WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED”, because
the server certificate and the IP address of the GitLab server do not
match.

The IP address mismatch issue can be resolved by using a floating IP,
which is IP failover in a router, but has to be supported both by the
router device and the network. If the new address is in a secondary
geographical location, both locations need to be on the same network and
have the same core router.

**Using recovery from snapshots is best suited for single virtual
servers.**

### Multiple application servers

It is possible to create a split between the application server, the
file system and the DBMS. If resources are available, you can use a load
balancer to assign tasks to multiple application servers. This way, if
one of the application servers fails, the workflow is not interrupted,
and at most the workflow gets slower as the load is shared between less
machines.

The setup is described in the below picture.

This solution also requires a shared file system (NFS), so it is only
available for GitLab versions 6.0 and up. At this point, you should
consider putting the filesystem storage and DBMS on separate machines
as well. Moreover, the filesystem storage and the DBMS will need recovery
protocols on their own (through snapshots or backups).

### Single slave server

**If you only want to use two machines for your HA solution, we
recommend keeping one as a slave of the other.** In this situation, each
machine has the full GitLab repositories, configuration, and the
database. The slave server is a copy of the master. You can use
Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) to ensure that all data from
the master is replicated to the slave in a timely manner.

Manual failover is done by mounting the file storage on the slave, which
is turned into a master. At this point, the unavailable server should be
turned off or taken off the network, to avoid it coming online with
master status.

This option is feasible both for users who want to keep their slave
server in the same data center, or if they want it in a different
geographical location.

### Filesystem storage and DBMS slave servers

**It is not possible to combine the multiple application servers
solution with a single slave server.** In this situation you need to
have a second site with multiple stateless application servers and a
filesystem storage and DBMS slave server.

Users will still connect via the load balanced application
servers, but the filesystem storage and the DBMS are copied to a slave server(s)
in the same datacenter or in another location. Distributed Replicated
Block Device (DRBD) can be used to pass data from the master filesystem storage
and DBMS servers to the slaves.

There is very little state on the application server in GitLab, so we
don’t recommend having a slave application server alongside the
filesystem storage and the DBMS. Using a load balancer results in the same
workflow impact, but in a more simple manner.

Automated failover can be achieved with pacemaker alongside STONITH
network management. Keep in mind that application servers need to be
prepared for transitioning to the new network addresses.

In this situation you can also opt to synchronize the database via a
database specific protocol instead of DRBD. In the documentation for
each database you can find out more about the [options for MySQL]
and the [options for PostgreSQL].

### GitLab GEO

Since the [release of version 8.5], GitLab GEO allows you to have a remote
replica of your entire GitLab instance. This consists of a master server
that runs [GitLab Enterprise Edition][ee], and slave servers with GitLab GEO
where you can only read Git repositories. This is for example useful when you
have a large number of people or CI tools cloning repositories and your wide
area network (WAN) doesn't have the capacity or availability for this. Please
contact our sales people for more information, and see our
[technical documentation][geo] for more details.

## Please get in touch

Supporting High Availability setups is something we take very serious at
GitLab. The information we provide here is just a rough guide designed
to help you get a feel of the hardware, software, and process
implications of different HA setups. When it comes to your specific
situation, we prefer to assess it in its context. We strongly suggest
you get in touch with us before setting it up. Support for HA is
included with the [Standard Subscription], and take a look at
the available [technical documentation][ha-docs] on this topic as well.
