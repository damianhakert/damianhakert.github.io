          If your team prefers to use JIRA you can easily disable GitLab's Issue iracker and integrate JIRA. You can still reference and close JIRA issues from within GitLab.

          When the team grows you can add new users now and pay later with GitLab's True Up model. If someone leaves the team, simply block the user and transfer the license.
