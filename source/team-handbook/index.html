        <h2>General</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Working at GitLab B.V. is cooperating with the most talented people you've ever worked with, being the <b>most productive</b> you'll ever be, creating software that is helping the most people you've ever reached.</li>
            <li>We recognize that inspiration is perishable, if you’re <b>enthusiastic</b> about something that generates great results in relatively little time feel free to work on that.</li>
            <li>Do what is right for our <b>customers</b> and the rest of the GitLab community, do what is best over the long term, don't be evil.</li>
            <li>We create <b>simple</b> software to accomplish complex collaborative tasks.</li>
            <li>Do <b>not</b> make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin colour, gender or sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and <b>speak up</b>.</li>
            <li>Work out in the <b>open</b>, try to use public issue trackers and repositories when possible.</li>
            <li>Share solutions your find and answers you receive with the <b>whole community</b>.</li>
            <li>If you make a mistake don't worry, correct it and <b>proactively</b> let the team know what happened.</li>
            <li>You can always <b>refuse</b> to deal with people that treat you bad and get out of situations that make your very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Everyone can <b>remind</b> anyone in the company about the above points. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions. </li>
            <li>If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer) please let your boss or the CEO know as soon as you realize it, we want to solve problems while they are <b>small</b>.</li>
            <li>We want to have a great company so if you meet people that are <b>better</b> than yourself try to recruit them to join the company.</li>
            <li>Our strategy is detailed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/document/d/1tco4-arhiA3V-XUJAkTtJ6zrfvT0OrUHtID2S1qVsXE/edit">GitLab Strategy document</a>, please read it and contribute.</li>

        <div class="workflow">
          <h2>Workflow</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Always <b>create</b> an issue for stuff you work on. If it is worth spending time one it is worth creating an issue for it since that enables other people to learn and help. You can always edit the description or close it when the problem is something different or disappears.</li>
            <li><b>'Double check'</b> issues to prevent internal confusion and us not circling back to the reporters. For example open an issue with link to ZenDesk and close the issue with copy of the response. Or you add 'Report: ' lines to the description with links to relevant issues and feature requests and ensure they are closed and note this with a comment. If you are not responsible for reporting back please do not close an issue but reassign it.</li>
            <li>If issues are related <b>crosslink</b> them (a link from each issue to the other one). Put the links in the top of the issues description with a short mention of the relation (Report, etc.). If there are more than 2 issues use one issue as the central one and crosslink all issues to this one. Please also crosslink between Zendesk and GitLab issues.</li>
            <li>Give the community the <b>chance to help</b>. For example: put issues on the feedback tracker, leave comments in rake check tests about what you can run manually and ask 'can you send a merge request to fix this?'.</li>
            <li>Do not leave issues open for a long time, issues should be <b>actionable</b> and realistic. If you are assigned but don't have time mention Sytse. If nobody is assigned and it is not a priority please ensure the community can help and close it.</li>
            <li>Make a conscious effort to <b>prioritize</b> your work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: is there a team member waiting for the answer, what is the impact if you delay it, how many people does it affect, etc. What follows is a general guideline from urgent to less urgent:</li>
            <li><b>Emergency</b> issues from standard or plus subscribers.</li>
            <li><b>Security</b> issues.</li>
            <li><b>Data integrity</b> (not losing data).</li>
            <li><b>Availability</b> of GitLab.com.</li>
            <li><b>Subscriber</b> questions.</li>
            <li><b>Regression</b> issues.</li>
            <li><b>Consultancy</b> work.</li>
            <li><b>Promised</b> features.</li>
            <li><b>Growth</b> efforts.</li>
            <li><b>Other</b> work.</li>
            <li>We keep our <b>promises</b> and do not make external promises without internal agreement.</li>
            <li>We try not to assign issues but to have people <b>pick issues</b> in a milestone themselves, do not pick one until you are actually working on it.</li>
            <li>Use <b>async communication</b> when possible (issues and email instead of chat), issues are preferred over email, email is preferred over Slack.</li>
            <li>Explicitly note what <b>next action</b> you propose or expect and from who.</li>
            <li>If you need to discuss with a team member for help please realize that probably the majority of the community also doesn't know, be sure to <b>document</b> the answer to radiate this information to the whole community.</li>
            <li>Be <b>specific</b> in your written communication, especially externally. Do not reply with a generalization when you can give an example.</li>
            <li>All company data should be <b>sharable</b> by default. Don't use a local text file but leave comments on an issue. Create a presentation in the GitLab dropbox. Create Google docs on our Google Apps account and make Sytse the owner.</li>
            <li>Do not close an issue until it has been <b>reported</b> back to all parties and issue trackers involved.</li>
            <li>If you are assigned to merge a Merge Request and there is a merge conflict, consider trying to resolve it <b>yourself</b> instead of asking the MR creator to resolve the conflict. If it is easy to resolve you avoid a roundtrip between you and the creator and the MR gets merged sooner. This a suggestion, not an obligation.</li>
            <li>When you create a merge request please <b>mention</b> the issue that it solves in the description but avoid auto closing it by saying Fixes #1 or Solves #1. Since we frequently have to report back to customers or the rest of the community issues are not done when the code is merged.</li>            
          </ol>

        <div class="security">
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Never reuse</b> a password you use on a company account (not for another Gitlab service or for a personal account).</li>
            <li>Set up a <b>password manager</b> (you probably want to use LastPass).</li>
            <li>Do not let your password manager store the <b>master password</b> (it is ok to store the login).</li>
            <li><b>Encrypt</b> your home folder (easy on Ubuntu/Debian, on OS X use FileVault2 full disk encryption.).</li>
            <li>Set up a screen saver with password <b>lock</b> on your notebook. The timeout can depend on how you use it (Sytse uses a 1-hour lock on his notebook).</li>
            <li><b>Report</b> suspect situations to <a href="mailto:sytse@gitlab.com?Subject=Reporting%20suspect%20situations" target="_top">sytse@gitlab.com.</a></li>
            <li>If you have security <b>suggestions</b> put them on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxTUCMo3TJVFziI-8FYztgYb55bKkDGfVEr5_wVHg4I/edit">agenda</a>.</li>
            <li>Never <b>dismiss</b> a security report as invalid. Keep asking questions until the researcher comes to this conclusion or stops responding.</li>
            <li>Do not <b>forward</b> company emails (@.gitlab.com) to a non-company email address.</li>

          <h2>Taking Days Off</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Note the days off in your employee <b>doc</b> (do this before sending the invite).</li>
            <li>Add an <b>appointment</b> to the GitLab B.V. availability calendar as you know your plans, you can always change it later.</li>
            <li>In case it can be useful add your time off as a <b>FYI</b> on the next agenda.</li>
            <li>In case people need to be around (we can't all go on vacation at the same time) the <b>first invite wins</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>official</b> days off in the country you are currently in apply.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-page/survival-kit/dutch-holidays">Dutch holidays</a> (only the official ones) 9 fixed days per year (23 off days you can choose, total 32)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/netherlands/">Netherlands holidays</a> Also kings birthday</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/index.php">USA holidays</a> (12 fixed days, 20 days you can choose, total 32)</li>
            <li>Patricio will do a mix of Ecuador and US holidays</li>
            <li>We will <b>help</b> clients during official days off unless they are official days off in both the Netherlands and the U.S. We try to have people work who are in a country that don't have an official day off. If you need to work during an official day off you get a day off allowance in return.</li>
            <li>You don't need to take days off to go to the gym, go grocery shopping, doing household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If something comes up or takes longer than expected and you are able to communicate just ensure the rest of the team <b>knows</b> and someone can pick up any urgent tasks.</li>
            <li>Ensure that not more than <b>half</b> of the people that can help with availability emergencies (24/7), sales or development are gone at any moment.</li>
            <li>If someone from the 24/7 team leaves set up a <b>call</b> two weeks before that so the other people can divide the days.</li>
            <li>Accumulated time off will not be <b>paid</b> out but will not expire for now.</li>
