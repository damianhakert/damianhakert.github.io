## Summits

Approximately every 6-9 months, we gather in person to see how tall everyone is (hard to see with video confercing), and to
get to know each other better by working and 'playing' together. Here are some
 [Impressions from the Summit in Amsterdam, October 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/11/30/gitlab-summit-2015/)


## Internal Feedback

By sending out our Feedback Form (find the link to the "open" form by accessing
[this "closed" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZAACGeS2_nz6AFXqf78x9iv2LB_hyX9fcT4s9nJF4M/edit) )
we gather feedback from the team members anonymously. We then share the main highlights
and concerns / wishes / things people wonder about with the entire team by discussing
them during our [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call) and posting
all topics that came up along with their responses here (with the exception of
  [topics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#general-guidelines) that by nature
  are not shared outside of the company).

### Feedback from January 2016, and responses

#### "What do you wish we had / What are you wondering about"

1. "Contractor or employee? Worried about job security as a contractor."
   * We value all team members equally, regardless of the legal arrangement that
   you have with GitLab. Due to legal restrictions and the difficulty of having
   people be employees outside of the US or NL (where we have a legal entity), a
   large portion of the team are contractors (21 out of 46). At GitLab, as everywhere
   else, job security relies mostly on how you are performing as a team member,
   and how the company performs as a whole. By the way, the contracts that we use
   are all viewable on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/
1. "More patience and consideration with ideas from newer people, things are sometimes
quickly rejected as 'won't work' or 'not interested' without much explanation."
   * It is difficult to comment on what may have been specific circumstances,
   but if you have felt that your idea was rejected too quickly or without explanation,
   then please know that this was not intended to be unkind or harsh. There are
   many ideas and for the sake of efficiency we give minimal reasoning in responding.
   This is also due to the nature of asynchronous communication where it is hard
   to tell if an answer is extensive enough to satisfy the question. If you feel
   that an idea is being rejected rather quickly, you **can** and **should**
   request more explanation. This might lead to a fruitful discussion and a reconsideration.
 1. "Wish we had more time"/ "Wonder if sometimes we go too fast and should go slower
 to focus on quality and testing more"
    * Please make sure you take enough
    [time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#paid-time-off) to recharge!
    Having a rapid release cycle contributes to increasing quality over time being able to iterate faster. For
    particular concerns in an individual issue, please raise your concerns in the
    issue. Because GitLab has gotten very popular the absolute amount of bugs might be increasing.
    But to individual users it feels like we've "[been squashing bugs and releasing
    features rapidly while also decreasing the number of regressions introduced and
    improving their test suit across the board](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11039966)".
    Obviously quality is and will always be a top concern, especially code quality
    since that enables better testing, faster fixes, and more contributions.

#### "What do you like about working here?"

1. A lot of love for the team
   * keywords people used to describe their fellow team members are: 'talented,
   caring, teamwork, approachable, honesty, frankness, smart, brilliant, skilled,
   team spirit'.
1. Great product
   * Four people mentioned it specifically, and this one sums it up nicely: "Working
   on a product that I actually love to use".

## Feedback from the GitLab team - September 2015

#### "What we love about working at GitLab"
Freedom, flexibility, enthusiasm, passion, great, smart, engaging,
enjoy teaching, feels like a family, great dynamic, supportive,
approachable execs, supportive, transparency, Speed of innovation, remote working,
company sponsored training,great Summit in Amsterdam.

#### But also
Great product, ability to create new processes,
company  growth, no burocracy. No high pressure, opportunity, our growth,
the challenge of maintaining quality of people, product, brand etc,
laser focus on improving collaboration through social coding, market adoption,
our work is public, so we can talk about it and our ability to create new processes.

#### What we wish we had or what we want to be doing & What we’re doing about it:

1. More team members.
  - We’re hiring
2. Bigger feature gap between CE and EE.
  -	Current plan is to have one EE feature added per release, so over time the difference will grow.
3. More summits.
  -	Current plan is to have a summit every 6-9 months.
4. Better onboarding.
  -	We're working on this with GitLabUniversity (GLU) content, continuous improvements to documentation and the handbook
5. Customer success events, starting in the Bay Area.
  -	Cool idea, start an issue and make it happen!
6. Coaching on Agile and Lean approaches for Engineering team.
  -	Great idea, we'll look into it. Suggestions are welcome.
7. A scale with happiness of last work week for feedback.
  -	We've working this into our feedback from in a different setting for now.
8. Global presence of Service Engineers, and dedicated trainer and training materials.
  -	We're working on this through hiring. Also, we have high hopes of GLU, ongoing content creation, etc. to help out here.

#### What we’re wondering about & the answers to our thoughts:

1. Stock options: terms, conditions
  - Does the handbook answer your questions? (https://about.gitlab.co/handbook/stock-options). Please feel free to ask Paul.
2. RocketChat & Mattermost. When will a decision be made?
  - Not entirely clear, nor is it entirely predictable. Sid has been giving roughly weekly updates.
3. If Azure was a bag idea.
  - In hindsight, yes.
4. What the company will look like 3, 6, 12 months from now? (community-ish, enterprise-ish)
  - The community and people using GitLab will keep growing. 12 months from now we'll answer all questions from the community on all platforms (from forum to Stack Overflow), we'll have a proper swag shop and have more developer oriented content (blog posts, video's).
Enterprise wise we'll have double the features we have now, a twice as large sales team, and many add-ons. Feel free to ask something more specific if you need more detail. And of course try to shape it as you think it should look.
5. How committed are we to building EE features and having significant releases  each month?
  - Very committed. At least one tentpole EE feature every month. Next 3 releases contain 2 or 3 each! https://about.gitlab.com/direction/
6. Sales team hiring plan
  - We're hiring but it is not a priority until everyone is up to speed and trained. But we expect that to happen soon, and the marketing machine will come up to speed in January, I expect that hiring becomes a priority then.
