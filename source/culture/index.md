## Summits

Approximately every 6-9 months, we gather in person to see how tall everyone is (hard to see with video confercing), and to
get to know each other better by working and 'playing' together. Here are some
 [Impressions from the Summit in Amsterdam, October 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/11/30/gitlab-summit-2015/)


## Internal Feedback

By sending out our Feedback Form (find the link to the "open" form by accessing
[this "closed" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZAACGeS2_nz6AFXqf78x9iv2LB_hyX9fcT4s9nJF4M/edit) )
we gather feedback from the team members anonymously. We then share the main highlights
and concerns / wishes / things people wonder about with the entire team by discussing
them during our [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call) and posting
all topics that came up along with their responses here (with the exception of
  [topics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#general-guidelines) that by nature
  are not shared outside of the company).

### Feedback from January 2016, and responses

#### "What do you wish we had / What are you wondering about"

1. "Contractor or employee? Worried about job security as a contractor."
   * We value all team members equally, regardless of the legal arrangement that
   you have with GitLab. Due to legal restrictions and the difficulty of having
   people be employees outside of the US or NL (where we have a legal entity), a
   large portion of the team are contractors (21 out of 46). At GitLab, as everywhere
   else, job security relies mostly on how you are performing as a team member,
   and how the company performs as a whole. By the way, the contracts that we use
   are all viewable on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/
1. "More patience and consideration with ideas from newer people, things are sometimes
quickly rejected as 'won't work' or 'not interested' without much explanation."
   * It is difficult to comment on what may have been specific circumstances,
   but if you have felt that your idea was rejected too quickly or without explanation,
   then please know that this was not intended to be unkind or harsh. There are
   many ideas and for the sake of efficiency we give minimal reasoning in responding.
   This is also due to the nature of asynchronous communication where it is hard
   to tell if an answer is extensive enough to satisfy the question. If you feel
   that an idea is being rejected rather quickly, you **can** and **should**
   request more explanation. This might lead to a fruitful discussion and a reconsideration.
 1. "Wish we had more time"/ "Wonder if sometimes we go too fast and should go slower
 to focus on quality and testing more"
    * Please make sure you take enough
    [time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#paid-time-off) to recharge!
    Having a rapid release cycle contributes to increasing quality over time being able to iterate faster. For
    particular concerns in an individual issue, please raise your concerns in the
    issue. Because GitLab has gotten very popular the absolute amount of bugs might be increasing.
    But to individual users it feels like we've "[been squashing bugs and releasing 
    features rapidly while also decreasing the number of regressions introduced and 
    improving their test suit across the board](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11039966)". 
    Obviously quality is and will always be a top concern, especially code quality 
    since that enables better testing, faster fixes, and more contributions.

#### "What do you like about working here?"

1. A lot of love for the team
   * keywords people used to describe their fellow team members are: 'talented,
   caring, teamwork, approachable, honesty, frankness, smart, brilliant, skilled,
   team spirit'.
1. Great product
   * Four people mentioned it specifically, and this one sums it up nicely: "Working
   on a product that I actually love to use".

### Feedback from October 2015, and responses

The results of this round of feedback gathering were shared internally by way of a
presentation: ["Stuff the GitLab team likes and does not like"](https://docs.google.com/a/gitlab.com/presentation/d/1h9P8Vf_6fzPbLCCahvwtIF5j_cH54zsv9iRSseVZzl0/edit?usp=sharing)
