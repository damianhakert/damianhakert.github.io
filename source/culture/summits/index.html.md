### General information


* Significant Others (SOs for short) are very welcome, one per team member
* You are responsible for the SO you invite
* SOs should do their best to get to know many people
* SOs are welcome at all presentations, events, and meetings that are open to all team members
* If you're having a meal with your SO, pick a table with more than two seats so you can invite others to join you

<br>

The goal of our summits is to get to know each other outside of work. 
To help get this kickstarted, always wear you name tag, to all events, and all days. Try to join different people every time we sit down for a meal.

* email/file templates for project page
* Audience is team members, applicants, SO's, partner companies, and wider community

### Health and safety

* Summit attendees need to be 18 years or older, children are not allowed to join
* We don't accept any form of (sexual) harassment
* We don't accept unbecoming behaviour from our team members nor their SOs (for example: don't get drunk, or do drugs or peer pressure people)
* When there is unbecoming behaviour bring people to their room (if people do get drunk bring them to their room)
* Don't use the pool or go swimming after midnight
* Be respectful of other hotel guests (for example: don't talk on your floor when going back at night or keeping your volume down on places such as the restaurant or bar)
