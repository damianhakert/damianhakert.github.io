## Advantages

<%= partial "includes/reasons_to_work_for_gitlab" %>

## Summits

Approximately every 9 months, we gather in person to see how tall everyone is (hard to see with video conferencing), and to get to know each other better "outside of work."

### Summit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands

Here are some impressions from our [first Summit](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/11/30/gitlab-summit-2015/) in October 2015.

### Summit in Austin, TX, the USA

In May 2016, with a team existing of 85 people, met up in Austin,TX to see if they are (still) as awesome as seen on Google Hangout.
Here is some footage that our team put together to show how much fun we had.

## Team Stories

What better way to convey a sense of who we are and how we work together, than by sharing the stories about it?

### The De Wet Show

[De Wet Blomerus](https://gitlab.com/dewetblomerus) is a Service Engineer and host of one of our [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call)’s favorite recurring segments, "The De Wet Show". It's been such a hit that we now open our Team Call every Monday with it! Some of his best episodes will be posted below.

    fields with cattle in them, and stare them down. Over the course of many

## Internal Feedback

By sending out our Feedback Form (find the link to the "open" form by accessing
[this "closed" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZAACGeS2_nz6AFXqf78x9iv2LB_hyX9fcT4s9nJF4M/edit))
we gather feedback from the team members anonymously. We then share the main highlights
and concerns / wishes / things people wonder about with the entire team by discussing
them during our [Team Call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call) and posting
all topics that came up along with their responses here (with the exception of
[topics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#general-guidelines) that by nature
are not shared outside of the company). _The responses may be altered from the original wording in an effort to maintain anonymity, while also maintaining the same spirit and message of the response._

### Feedback from the GitLab team - November 2016

#### What you like about working at GitLab

Remote working environment, product development, challenge of working on the product, potential we have for
"making it big," great co-workers, the sense of a team, great culture, the feeling of being valued, personal
responsibility, willingness of team members to teach new team members, transparency, and team calls.

#### What you would like to change & what we are doing about it

1. Make the handbook easier to navigate.
  * People Ops has added an [Onboarding 101](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-onboarding/onboarding-101/) page to help team members know where to start reading the handbook. In addition, we have added Standard Operating Procedures for different departments to make what you are looking for easier to find. Lastly, don't forget that there is a search function at the top of the handbook that can help you find exactly what you are looking for!
1. Spend more time learning the technical side of our product.
  * Check out [GitLab University](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/university/) to learn more about Git and GitLab. We will also be rolling out additional training on Git and GitLab during 2017 see [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/126).
1. Refine the hiring process.
  * We have revamped our [hiring process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/) to be more efficient. Our global recruiters are working hard to ensure that every candidate is kept in the loop about where they stand in the hiring process, and managers are not spending too much time in Workable reviewing candidates. If you have any questions please feel fee to reach out on the `#hiring` channel on Slack.
1. Refine the compensation principles.
  * Please check out our [Global Compensation Framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/global-compensation-framework/). If you have any questions or concerns about the compensation principles, please let People Ops know!
1. Focus on differentiating CE from EE.
  *  We plan to build features that are interesting for enterprises and replace existing products.
1. Focus on growth of team members within the organization.
  * People Ops has instituted Grovo (individual contributor and management training), as well as Lattice (OKRs) to assist in the growth of team members within their position at GitLab. We will continue to strive to work with managers to develop team members at GitLab by drafting Professional Development Plans see [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/170).
1. More face-to-face meetings and ability to meet up with team members close by.
  * Please expense travel to visit team members as described in [Spending Company Money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#spending-company-money).
1. Adjust the team call format to include more regular functional group updates.
  * The [team call](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#team-call) now has weekend updates every two weeks, a separate call for APAC team members to give their weekend update, and [functional group updates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-operations/functional-group-updates/) are separate events.
1. Have more employee agreements instead of contractor agreements.
  * People Ops will be working to establish new entities/payrolls in more countries as we grow. Once this is completed we can transfer contractors to employees.
1. Hire in departments that need more team members.
  * We understand that there is always a lot to do at GitLab and for some departments this means that we might need to hire more team members. If this is the case please communicate this to your manager and/or People Ops. If appropriate People Ops will [open the role](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/#vacancy-creation-process), and add it to the [jobs page](https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/).
1. Refine onboarding to be less intense/intimidating.
  * Onboarding can be a difficult task. To alleviate the confusion about what you are doing and why, we have created [Onboarding 101](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/general-onboarding/onboarding-101/).
1. Move unlimited vacation to a set amount so team members take their full vacation.
  * We are taking a look at what the best option is in regards to a limited or unlimited vacation. We want to urge that team members take enough [time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#paid-time-off) to recharge! Unlimited vacation/taking vacation is encourage at GitLab. For information on how these developments are going, check out the open [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/952)
1. Less downtime on GitLab.com.
  * Our Infastructure team is always looking for new ways to improve the ownership of the things we ship. The team will look to have owners of services or features, and these services working will be the way they prove that they are actually delivering. Infrastructure has also increased uptime to 99.91% in [December 2016](http://stats.pingdom.com/81vpf8jyr1h9/1902794/2016/12).
1. Casual and social interaction.
  * We have instituted [Coffee Breaks](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#coffee-break-calls) to promote catching up with team members. Also, all team members are just a click away on Slack or a call away on the [Random Hangout](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#random-room).
1. Revise Workable Notifications.
  * Sometimes it can be hard to manage Workable notifications. Here are some [guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/#general-points-about-moving-applicants-through-the-process) to keep your inbox low.

#### What are you wondering about / What we are missing

1. Are we growing too fast?
  * Check out our [strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/) page for why we are growing faster than feels intuitive.
1. How to improve myself as a professional?
  * Aside from the internal tools at GitLab, you can expense any course or training that falls in line with [Spending Company Money](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#spending-company-money). Questions? Just ask your manager or People Ops.
1. How are we using our series B funding?
  * We have released our [master plan](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/09/13/gitlab-master-plan/) for how we plan on growing as a company as a result of our Series B Funding. Also, check out our [Strategy Page](https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/).
1. What are the plans for parental leave?
  * We are currently working on this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/88).
1. What are the mid to long term engineering strategies?
  * Make GitLab.com fast and reliable (99% page loads < 1 s).
  * Make GitLab a next-generation product.
  * Make GitLab a great place for engineers to grow.
1. What does it take to move from a junior to intermediate or senior?
  * Some job descriptions have what is expected of a junior, intermediate, or senior, if applicable. For specific questions about each role, please speak with your manager. As this is still a work in progress for many roles, here is the open [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/168).
1. Is there process for compensation reviews?
  * People Ops will be working on this in 2017.
1. Will GitLab include a 401(k) match for US employees?
  * At this time, GitLab does not have a 401(k) match for US employees.
1. Improve gender diversity.
  * Our Global Recruiters are working to ensure that the hiring process promotes [diversity](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/#equal-employment-opportunity). We have also started a Slack Channel `#diversity_inclusion`. Please feel free to contribute at any time!
1. Manager and 1:1 training.
  * As we grow and develop our internal trainings, we will make sure to educate managers on what should be discussed in 1:1's to ensure that the team member's personal and professional development is the core theme of these conversations.
1. All meetings recorded by default.
  * All meetings that happen over Zoom are recorded and placed on the Google Drive under "GitLab Videos."
1. Instructions on how to build a project on GitLab.
  * Here is some [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-project.html) on how to build a project within GitLab.

We also received a many responses stating we should not change or add anything, and that GitLab is an awesome place to work. This is great that team members feel this way, and People Ops will continue to strive to create a culture where team members are satisfied and engaged. Want to see where most of these changes were made? Check out the [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/peopleops/issues/122)!

### Feedback from September 2016, and presentation of responses

1. Please checkout this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LNJEGKc0e7FpE5N17c2haYhU2VVVHkgh70ToDjX3f3U/edit#slide=id.g188ff13e8d_4_1) to see what responses and changes were made as a result of the September 2016 survey.

### Feedback from January 2016, and responses

#### "What do you wish we had / What are you wondering about"

1. "Contractor or employee? Worried about job security as a contractor."
   * We value all team members equally, regardless of the legal arrangement that
   you have with GitLab. Due to legal restrictions and the difficulty of having
   people be employees outside of the US or NL (where we have a legal entity), a
   large portion of the team are contractors (21 out of 46). At GitLab, as everywhere
   else, job security relies mostly on how you are performing as a team member,
   and how the company performs as a whole. By the way, the contracts that we use
   are all viewable on https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/contracts/
1. "More patience and consideration with ideas from newer people, things are sometimes
quickly rejected as 'won't work' or 'not interested' without much explanation."
   * It is difficult to comment on what may have been specific circumstances,
   but if you have felt that your idea was rejected too quickly or without explanation,
   then please know that this was not intended to be unkind or harsh. There are
   many ideas and for the sake of efficiency we give minimal reasoning in responding.
   This is also due to the nature of asynchronous communication where it is hard
   to tell if an answer is extensive enough to satisfy the question. If you feel
   that an idea is being rejected rather quickly, you **can** and **should**
   request more explanation. This might lead to a fruitful discussion and a reconsideration.
 1. "Wish we had more time"/ "Wonder if sometimes we go too fast and should go slower
 to focus on quality and testing more"
    * Please make sure you take enough
    [time off](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#paid-time-off) to recharge!
    Having a rapid release cycle contributes to increasing quality over time being able to iterate faster. For
    particular concerns in an individual issue, please raise your concerns in the
    issue. Because GitLab has gotten very popular the absolute amount of bugs might be increasing.
    But to individual users it feels like we've "[been squashing bugs and releasing
    features rapidly while also decreasing the number of regressions introduced and
    improving their test suit across the board](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11039966)".
    Obviously quality is and will always be a top concern, especially code quality
    since that enables better testing, faster fixes, and more contributions.
1. "Better supervision in the first two months"
   * Always be sure to reach out to your manager if you feel that you need more guidance. Your peers are a Slack message away.
1. "Maybe a more competitive salary"
   * From the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/#general-guidelines): "If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer) please let your boss, or the CEO, know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are small."
1. "A step between review/QA and deployment."
   * Review happens through merge requests, and QA happens as part of the release process. We can't think of anything else at the moment that would not introduce gates that cause delay and inefficiency.
1. "Off-site meetings during the year and/or team-specific summits, like a hackathon"
   * We had a Summit in Oct'15, and are having one in May'16. We aim to have these every 6-9 months. We are thinking about organizing a hackathon during the [Summit](https://gitlab.com/summits/Austin-Summit-2016-project/blob/master/Proposed_Activities.md); please upvote if you want it to happen!
1. "We share a lot about our software 'side'; can we share more about our other 'sides' (like how marketing does marketing) in a "team blog"? This would help in hiring awesome people!"
   * We love blog posts and sharing all of GitLab's 'sides'. Please channel your inner need to write a blog post (or part of it!) on our [blog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/blog-posts/issues) repo.
1. "Additional training for dev people, maybe? Specific suggestions for topics include agile coding, code quality, and there is a suggestion for Robert "Uncle Bob " Marcin (https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/) for code quality
  * After some research within the team there was a greater interest in a "birds of a feather" gathering than formal training. We're looking to do this during our Summit trip to Austin.
1. "What features are we planning? See [/direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction)
1. "How are we doing? How does the Board see it? Can we keep up the growth and the Sales?"
  * Khosla is really happy so far. Keeping up growth depends on demand generation
1. "If we are sometimes too open and too transparent in a way that hurts us?"
  * So far the only negative thing is that we suspect that competitors release their stuff early to preempt us, we think it is great that they are adjusting their schedule to ours!
1. "Creating/using a standard for interviewing candidates."
  * Good idea, a lot of us use standard interview questions https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/#interview-questions but merge requests are welcome.
1.  "More formality in development process."
  * What form of formality? We welcome changes that don't reduce our productivity. Potentially we could start using issue weights more to gauge the load.

#### "What do you like about working here?"

1. A lot of love for the team
   * Keywords people used to describe their fellow team members are: 'talented,
   caring, teamwork, approachable, honest, frank, smart, brilliant, skilled,
   team spirit'.
1. Great product
   * Four people mentioned it specifically, and this one sums it up nicely: "Working
   on a product that I actually love to use". Respondents also mentioned the fast pace of development.
1. Open Source
   * Respondents value being involved in Open Source, with phrases such as: 'proving that open source is awesome and working with the rest of the community, working on open source while getting paid for it is a dream job!'
1. Freedom and opportunity
   * We are a remote-first company and our team members like: 'being remote-first, working from home, having personal independence, the freedom to choose what to work on, the freedom that you don't get in a corporate office environment, flexibility to get things done, slim process, slack oriented'
   * People also mentioned the opportunity to learn, and the massive opportunity that the project and the company has.
1. Team dynamic
   * Several people mentioned that they really like the team dynamic, specifically: 'the support that you need is there, you have the ability to take on multiple hats and responsibilities, everyone and everything is open to constant improvement, ability to collaborate even though we're remote, we're remote but still have a great sense of "team", love the cross discipline collaboration that goes on every day'

### Feedback from the GitLab team - September 2015

Summarized in this presentation about ["Stuff the GitLab team likes and does not
