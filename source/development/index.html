          <li> If you are missing some functionality in GitLab you can sponsor the development of it.</li>
          <li> After you send in the form below we will check if the feature is acceptable to include in GitLab. If so we will first email back with a minimum cost estimate. This is to make sure the expectations of the work that is involved are realistic.</li>
          <li>If the minimum estimate matches your expectations we will work on a detailed estimate. If you accept the detailed estimate we will give you an estimated release date and start the work.</li>
          <li>A GitLab flow workshop help your organization develop a good git workflow in 2 hours</li>
          <li>We will inform you when the feature is ready and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/a88225b7689ab87b49908db23e1bebf1c7ea09d3/CHANGELOG#L8">note your sponsorship in the Changelog</a> (unless you ask us not to, no problem). From then on your feature is a part of GitLab and will probably be maintained without any additional cost to you.</li>
