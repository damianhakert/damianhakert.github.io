## Reaching Support

If your organization purchased **Premium Support**, this includes<br>
   - Regular support requests: next business day response.
   - Emergency requests: 30 minute response, 24/7.
   - How to submit regular and emergency requests: As part of receiving your license file, you should have received a set of email addresses to use to reach Support for regular and emergency requests (separate addresses). Please follow-up with us through the [support web form](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you did not receive this email address.
   - Two trainings

If your organization did _not_ purchase Premium Support, then please submit your support request through the [support web form](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
