## Reaching Support

### Premium Support

If your organization purchased **Premium Support** (TODO: add link to Amara's page), this includes<br>
   - Regular requests: next business day response.
   - Emergency requests: 1hr response time, 24/7 (response is typically much faster).
   - _How to submit regular and emergency requests:_ Please submit your support request through the [support web form](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). You can also send an email directly: as part of receiving your license file, you should have received a set of email addresses to use to reach Support for regular and emergency requests (separate addresses). Please follow-up with us through the [support web form](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you did not receive this email address.
   - Dedicated Service Engineer: your support requests will be handled by the same Service Engineer every time (under normal circumstances), who has a better handle on the specifics of your installation and environment.
   - Two [training workshops](/training). Please contact support to schedule a training and discuss the topics.
   - Live upgrade assistance. To schedule a time to have a Service Engineer be live with you via video-conference during an upgrade, please contact support.
