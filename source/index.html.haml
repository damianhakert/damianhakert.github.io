              **Build together:** GitLab includes Git repository management,
              code reviews, issue tracking, wikis, and [more](/features/), plus
              [GitLab CI](/gitlab-ci/), an easy-to-use continuous integration and deployment
              tool.

              **Stay up-to-date:** Collaborate with your team using issues,
              milestones, and line-by-line code review. View activity streams of
              projects or the people you work with.

              **Plays well with others:** GitLab seamlessly integrates with
              Slack, Hipchat, LDAP, JIRA, Jenkins, and many other popular tools.
              GitLab includes many webhooks and offers a complete API.

              **Updated Monthly:** We release a new version of GitLab each month
              on the 22nd and it'll only take you 2 minutes to update.

              **Community Input:** We listen to our community when deciding what
              to release next. Follow along with our [upcoming releases](/direction).

              **Scales Effortlessly:** GitLab runs smoothly on any size server
              but can scale to multiple active servers. A single server can
              handle more than 25,000 users.
