        <h3>Branch</h3>
            <p>
              A Branch is a parallel version of a repository. Allows you to work on the repository without you affecting the "master" branch.
              Allows you to make changes without affecting the current "live" version.
              When you have made all your changes to your branch you can then merge to the master and to make the changes fo "live".
            </p>
        <h3>Commit</h3>
            <p>
              A commit is any individual change to a file or repository just like saving a file.
              Commits have the added benefit that each commit creates a unique ID "SHA" that will give a full audit trail of when and by who the commits was done.
