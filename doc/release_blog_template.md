Upgrade instructions for omnibus-gitlab packages can be found in [the omnibus-gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/doc/update.md).

If you installed GitLab from source and you have version 6.4.2 or higher you can use the [upgrade script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/upgrader.md).
You have to update GitLab Shell to ***X.X.X*** manually, see [point 3 of the upgrade guide](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/update/X.x-to-x.x.md#3-update-gitlab-shell-and-its-config).

For LDAP group support and more have a look at the [feature list of GitLab Enterprise Edition](http://www.gitlab.com/gitlab-ee/).
